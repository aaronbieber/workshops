Hi Aaron,

You're registered for the Boston: South Bay
workshop; you'll be a pro by the time we're done with you!

Our online payment system isn't quite up to snuff yet, so we'll be in
touch with you very soon to work out the details. If you'd like to
send us a check (personal check, cashier's check, etc.), you may do
so. Don't send us cash!

The cost of this workshop is $149.00.

Please make checks payable to Aaron Bieber and send them to:

Art Photo Workshops
c/o Aaron Bieber
13 Washington St #3
New London, CT 06320

After your payment is squared away, we'll send you your registration
package in the mail. The package will contain information about the
workshop, lodging suggestions, a hard copy of our itinerary, useful
tips, and an orientation questionnaire.

We'll spend four days and nights making photographs from before sunrise until well into the night. Aaron and Chris will serve as your guides to aesthetic approach and technical application as you explore some of these breathtaking Death Valley locations:\r\n\r\n* Badwater\r\n* Artist's Palette\r\n* Dante's View\r\n* Stovepipe Well Dunes\r\n* Eureka Dunes\r\n* Golden Canyon\r\n* Devil's Golf Course\r\n* The Alabama Hills\r\n* and more!\r\n\r\n$register$\r\n\r\nThere will be a strong focus on night photography including work with light painting and star trails. This workshop is designed to coincide with the new moon, giving us nights filled with stars. If you have never done photography at night before, or if you want to get better at it, this is the right workshop for you. Between the two of us we have 12 years of experience making wonderful images at night. \r\n\r\nThis workshop gives you the opportunity to photograph a famous and unique location with two professional photographers who will help you get the *most* out of every hour and out of every exposure.\r\n\r\nh2. Who should attend this workshop?\r\n\r\nAnyone who wants to advance their photography skills and get the absolute most out of a trip to Death Valley. In a limited amount of time we'll bring you to the best locations at the best times and work with you both in the field and in front of the computer to help you get great results.\r\n\r\nh2. Itinerary\r\n\r\nHere's the plan.\r\n\r\nh3. Friday April 4th\r\n\r\nWe will meet in the afternoon (you'll be emailed the exact time and place to meet at least two weeks prior to the workshop). Each participant will receive a workshop package including information and equipment (listed below). We will then have introductions, get to know one another, and get a feel for what each of you hope to accomplish during the workshop. We will set out in the early evening to photograph sunset and then do an introduction to night photography.\r\n\r\nh3. Saturday April 5th - Monday April 7th\r\n\r\nEach day of the workshop will be broken up into three sessions, described here:\r\n\r\n*Session 1 - Dawn*\r\n\r\nWe'll meet in an agreed upon location and set out to photograph dawn, then return to the inn for breakfast.\r\n\r\n*Session 2 - Late morning*\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we'll get together to review the work we've done so far, go over any  questions, and plan shooting locations for the remainder of the day. Participants who shoot digital and have a laptop with them are welcome to share their work with the group. Chris and Aaron will be available to do one-on-one critiques and offer guidance.\r\n\r\nThere are a few locations that can be effective during morning and afternoon sun, such as Golden Canyon, so we may opt to explore one of those locations together during the day. If you wish to explore on your own, you are welcome to.\r\n\r\n*Session 3 - Sunset*\r\n\r\nWe will travel to our chosen location to photograph sunset. After night falls, we will commence night photography sessions. It is not unusual for the ambitious in the group to photograph well into the night.\r\n\r\nNote: Some of you may not want to join us for the next sunrise session. You can meet us at breakfast, normally around 9-9:30 AM.\r\n\r\nSince the conditions in Death Valley change from day to day, it's impossible to predict the perfect location for each session. Both Chris and Aaron have a good deal of experience with Death Valley and will plan our locations to best fit the changing conditions. Our first priority is making great photographs, no matter what the circumstances.\r\n\r\nThough we will be photographing locations as a group, each will offer the opportunity to spread out across a large area. Two-way radios can come in handy, so we're going to give you one. It's an effective method for the group to communicate across distances of a mile or more, and we'll also use the radios to communicate between vehicles while traveling to each location.\r\n\r\nh2. Registration\r\n\r\nThe cost of this once-in-a-lifetime experience is only $1,199 and is open to photographers of all skill levels. To register, please \"send us an email\":mailto:dvworkshop@fisheyegallery.com. We accept all major credit cards as well as personal checks. After you contact us, we'll mail you our registration package. Workshops are filled on a first-come first-served basis, so don't miss out!\r\n\r\nWorkshop fees are refundable up to 60 days before the workshop, less 10% for processing fees. Within 60 days of the workshop a refund is not possible.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to e-mail us with any questions.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will have a maximum of ten participants. Sorry, but no guests are permitted to tag along. We find that the group is most focused and productive when we are all actively photographing, and we don't want to dilute the experience for any of our attendees.\r\n\r\nh3. Important Notes\r\n\r\n* This is not an all-inclusive trip and as such does not include transportation, food, or lodging. Your registration package will contain a thorough list of available hotels and campgrounds as well as our advice on staying in Death Valley.\r\n* Though meal cost is not included, we'll eat at the same time each day and you may wish to join us, or feel free to go out on your own during this time.\r\n* Your registration package will also include detailed information on the trip as well as a very basic questionnaire that we use to tailor the workshop for you.\r\n* We will not be taking any long hikes, but some hiking will be required. This is not a stressful amount of exercise by any means, but you should be in decent physical shape and able to navigate the irregular desert terrain.\r\n\r\nh2. Gear\r\n\r\nYou'll need some things on this trip...\r\n\r\nh3. What you should bring\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is open to all skill levels, you should have at least a 35mm SLR (digital or film) camera and a tripod. You should also have a basic understanding of how your camera works. We would be glad to help you get the most out of your equipment while on the workshop, but it won't be a fundamental course, so be sure you are familiar with the basics.\r\n\r\nIf you want to brush up or review, you may want to read these articles (posted here):\r\n\r\n* \"Histograms, Huh?\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/06/03/histograms-huh/\r\n* \"Be a Control Freak--Shooting Modes Explained\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/05/29/be-a-control-freak-shooting-modes-explained/\r\n* \"Focal Length Reciprocal Rule\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/05/22/focal-length-reciprocal-rule/\r\n\r\nAnd also these assorted articles from Earthbound Light Photography:\r\n\r\n* \"I Bought a Digital Camera But My Photos Are Still Blurry\":http://www.earthboundlight.com/phototips/digital-photography-still-photography.html\r\n* \"Program vs. Aperture Priority vs. Shutter Priority vs. Manual\":http://www.earthboundlight.com/phototips/program-aperture-shutter-priority-manual-exposure.html\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in advice on what to bring (or what to buy), you can \"email Chris\":mailto:cblake@curiouslens.com. He has a lot of equipment experience and would be happy to share it with you.\r\n\r\nThe weather in Death Valley can go from very warm to very cold. You should pack accordingly, keeping in mind that in windy conditions before dawn and after the sun goes down it can feel very cold.\r\n\r\nh3. What we will give you\r\n\r\nAs part of the workshop experience, we will provide you with a few essential items that we have found to be indispensable on these trips.  The Death Valley Workshop package includes a GMRS(General Mobile Radio Service) (family band) two-way radio with several-mile range; a bright xenon flashlight for light painting and general navigation; a rugged, waterproof National Geographic map of the park that we will refer to often; and lots of information about the art and science of photographing on location and specifically in Death Valley. All of these items are, of course, yours to keep.\r\n\r\nh2. Who are you?\r\n\r\nHere's a little about us and why you're going to love to learn and explore with us in Death Valley.\r\n\r\nh3. Christopher Blake\r\n\r\nI am a fine art travel photographer living in the Boston area. I have worked exclusively with digital cameras for the past six years, focusing on traditional fine art landscapes, HDR (high dynamic range), and night photography. I have an extensive background in information technology and I leverage that knowledge to get the most out of my photographs. I am excited to share my experience in travel photography with you in Death Valley!\r\n\r\nView Chris's gallery, \"The Curious Lens\":http://www.curiouslens.com.\r\n\r\nh3. Aaron Bieber\r\n\r\nI am an illustrator, photographer, web and graphic designer living and working on the scenic Connecticut coast (I am also the author of this blog). Though I have been very serious about photography for many years, I come from a traditional art background and I have written at length on the topics of photography as an art form and the techniques and practices unique to photography as a medium for artistic expression. My main interests in photography are geometric abstractions and exploring the invisible world as can only be seen through the lens of a camera.\r\n\r\nWith over ten years of Photoshop experience and as an outspoken fan of Photoshop Lightroom, I do my best work in post-production. I look forward to helping you make the most of a very unique experience during this workshop!\r\n\r\nView Aaron's gallery, \"Fisheye Multimedia Galleries\":http://www.fisheyegallery.com", "short_name"=>"DeathV alley", "max_students"=>"10"}, "object"=>"workshop"}

Hi Aaron,

You're registered for the Death Valley National Park
workshop; you'll be a pro by the time we're done with you!

Our online payment system isn't quite up to snuff yet, so we'll be in
touch with you very soon to work out the details. If you'd like to
send us a check (personal check, cashier's check, etc.), you may do
so. Don't send us cash!

The cost of this workshop is $1,199.00.

Please make checks payable to Aaron Bieber and send them to:

Art Photo Workshops
c/o Aaron Bieber
13 Washington St #3
New London, CT 06320

After your payment is squared away, we'll send you your registration
package in the mail. The package will contain information about the
workshop, lodging suggestions, a hard copy of our itinerary, useful
tips, and an orientation questionnaire.

Hi Aaron,

You're registered for the Death Valley National Park
workshop; you'll be a pro by the time we're done with you!

Our online payment system isn't quite up to snuff yet, so we'll be in
touch with you very soon to work out the details. If you'd like to
send us a check (personal check, cashier's check, etc.), you may do
so. Don't send us cash!

The cost of this workshop is $1,199.00.

Please make checks payable to Aaron Bieber and send them to:

Art Photo Workshops
c/o Aaron Bieber
13 Washington St #3
New London, CT 06320

After your payment is squared away, we'll send you your registration
package in the mail. The package will contain information about the
workshop, lodging suggestions, a hard copy of our itinerary, useful
tips, and an orientation questionnaire.

The park spans a wide range of elevations, from 875 to 6,643 feet above sea level. The variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of animal and plant life. About 10,000 species are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 90,000 undocumented species may also be present.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is scheduled to coincide with the peak of fall color in the park as well as the new moon. Though it's difficult to predict the peak of foliage change precisely, the range of elevations in the park gives the photographer a good deal of \"wiggle room.\" Even if colors haven't peaked at 800 feet, odds are good that at over 3,000 feet you'll see the full color of the Great Smokies. Thanks to the size of the park the night skies are very dark—especially during a new moon—which makes great astronomical images possible.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is open to photographers of all skill levels and is limited to eight participants. There is no heavy hiking involved; we will be doing a lot of walking on paved roads as well as trails, but this is not a wilderness trek. To get the most out of this workshop you should be able to walk at least a few miles along easy terrain and expect to arise before dawn and stay out into the night each day.\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is _all-inclusive_, we are sorry that we cannot offer transportation. The park has very tight roads and at times we'll be driving on unpaved passages, which would be clumsy for a large van. We'll make our best efforts to organize carpools, but you should be prepared to \"play it by ear\" or to caravan in your own vehicle.\r\n\r\nAs with all of our workshops, each person will be given a National Geographic park map, a two-way radio, and a generous package of information on the history, geography, and climate of the national park as well as photography tips and guidelines to use during the workshop and in the future.\r\n\r\nh2. Itinerary\r\n\r\nOctober 25th\r\n\r\nWe'll meet late in the day in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. You may drive to Gatlinburg directly or fly into Knoxville, Tennessee. We'll have introductions at dinner that evening.\r\n\r\nh3. October 26th-29th\r\n\r\nFrom our hotel we'll make two trips daily into the park: one before dawn to photograph from the first light of day until mid-morning, and a second trip a few hours before the sun goes down to capture sunset and then move to another location for astronomical and night photography.\r\n\r\nEach day we will have opportunities to photograph the abundant wildlife in the park including deer, black bears, birds, and more. We'll take you to the best locations to capture beautiful landscapes and make sure you're in the best places at the best times. For example, we will walk into Cades Cove—a lush valley surrounded by mountains and a popular destination—just before dawn to capture the best light of day while tourists in their cars wait for the gate to be unlocked and miss out on all the good stuff!\r\n\r\nSome of the locations we'll photograph are:\r\n* Cades Cove\r\n* Clingman's Dome\r\n* Laurel Falls\r\n* New Found Gap Road\r\n* Mingus Mill\r\n\r\nh3.

To get the most out of this workshop you should be able to walk at least a few miles along easy terrain and expect to arise before dawn and stay out into the night each day.\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is _all-inclusive_, we are sorry that we cannot offer transportation. The park has very tight roads and at times we\'ll be driving on unpaved passages, which would be clumsy for a large van. We\'ll make our best efforts to organize carpools, but you should be prepared to \"play it by ear\" or to caravan in your own vehicle.\r\n\r\nAs with all of our workshops, each person will be given a National Geographic park map, a two-way radio, and a generous package of information on the history, geography, and climate of the national park as well as photography tips and guidelines to use during the workshop and in the future.\r\n\r\nh2. Itinerary\r\n\r\nOctober 25th\r\n\r\nWe\'ll meet late in the day in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. You may drive to Gatlinburg directly or fly into Knoxville, Tennessee. We\'ll have introductions at dinner that evening.\r\n\r\nh3. October 26th-29th\r\n\r\nFrom our hotel we\'ll make two trips daily into the park: one before dawn to photograph from the first light of day until mid-morning, and a second trip a few hours before the sun goes down to capture sunset and then move to another location for astronomical and night photography.\r\n\r\nEach day we will have opportunities to photograph the abundant wildlife in the park including deer, black bears, birds, and more. We\'ll take you to the best locations to capture beautiful landscapes and make sure you\'re in the best places at the best times. For example, we will walk into Cades Cove—a lush valley surrounded by mountains and a popular destination—just before dawn to capture the best light of day while tourists in their cars wait for the gate to be unlocked and miss out on all the good stuff!\r\n\r\nSome of the locations we\'ll photograph are:\r\n* Cades Cove\r\n* Clingman\'s Dome\r\n* Laurel Falls\r\n* New Found Gap Road\r\n* Mingus Mill\r\n\r\nh3. October 30th\r\n\r\nWe may make a last trip into the park to pick up any sights we haven\'t yet seen, and then it\'s farewell. Check-out from the hotel is before noon.', 'SmokyMountains', 8, 1, '2007-11-16 23:21:58')[0m

The park spans a wide range of elevations, from 875 to 6,643 feet above sea level.

About 10,000 species are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 90,000 undocumented species may also be present.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is scheduled to coincide with the peak of fall color in the park as well as the new moon. Though it's difficult to predict the peak of foliage change precisely, the range of elevations in the park gives the photographer a good deal of \"wiggle room.\" Even if colors haven't peaked at 800 feet, odds are good that at over 3,000 feet you'll see the full color of the Great Smokies.

The park spans a wide range of elevations, from 875 to 6,643 feet above sea level. The variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of animal and plant life. About 10,000 species are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 90,000 undocumented species may also be present.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is scheduled to coincide with the peak of fall color in the park as well as the new moon. Though it's difficult to predict the peak of foliage change precisely, the range of elevations in the park gives the photographer a good deal of \"wiggle room.\" Even if colors haven't peaked at 800 feet, odds are good that at over 3,000 feet you'll see the full color of the Great Smokies. Thanks to the size of the park the night skies are very dark—especially during a new moon—which makes great astronomical images possible.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is open to photographers of all skill levels and is limited to eight participants. There is no heavy hiking involved; we will be doing a lot of walking on paved roads as well as trails, but this is not a wilderness trek. To get the most out of this workshop you should be able to walk at least a few miles along easy terrain and expect to arise before dawn and stay out into the night each day.\r\n\r\n$image:left/Places/SmokyMountains/FloatingSun.jpg$\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is _all-inclusive_, we are sorry that we cannot offer transportation. The park has very tight roads and at times we'll be driving on unpaved passages, which would be clumsy for a large van. We'll make our best efforts to organize carpools, but you should be prepared to \"play it by ear\" or to caravan in your own vehicle.\r\n\r\nAs with all of our workshops, each person will be given a National Geographic park map, a two-way radio, and a generous package of information on the history, geography, and climate of the national park as well as photography tips and guidelines to use during the workshop and in the future.\r\n\r\nh2. Itinerary\r\n\r\nOctober 25th\r\n\r\nWe'll meet late in the day in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. You may drive to Gatlinburg directly or fly into Knoxville, Tennessee.

October 26th-29th\r\n\r\nFrom our hotel we'll make two trips daily into the park: one before dawn to photograph from the first light of day until mid-morning, and a second trip a few hours before the sun goes down to capture sunset and then move to another location for astronomical and night photography.\r\n\r\nEach day we will have opportunities to photograph the abundant wildlife in the park including deer, black bears, birds, and more. We'll take you to the best locations to capture beautiful landscapes and make sure you're in the best places at the best times.

October 26th-29th\r\n\r\nFrom our hotel we\'ll make two trips daily into the park: one before dawn to photograph from the first light of day until mid-morning, and a second trip a few hours before the sun goes down to capture sunset and then move to another location for astronomical and night photography.\r\n\r\nEach day we will have opportunities to photograph the abundant wildlife in the park including deer, black bears, birds, and more. We\'ll take you to the best locations to capture beautiful landscapes and make sure you\'re in the best places at the best times. For example, we will walk into Cades Cove—a lush valley surrounded by mountains and a popular destination—just before dawn to capture the best light of day while tourists in their cars wait for the gate to be unlocked and miss out on all the good stuff!\r\n\r\nSome of the locations we\'ll photograph are:\r\n\r\n* Cades Cove\r\n* Clingman\'s Dome\r\n* Laurel Falls\r\n* New Found Gap Road\r\n* Mingus Mill\r\n\r\nh3.

The park spans a wide range of elevations, from 875 to 6,643 feet above sea level. The variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of animal and plant life. About 10,000 species are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 90,000 undocumented species may also be present.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is scheduled to coincide with the peak of fall color in the park as well as the new moon. Though it's difficult to predict the peak of foliage change precisely, the range of elevations in the park gives the photographer a good deal of \"wiggle room.\" Even if colors haven't peaked at 800 feet, odds are good that at over 3,000 feet you'll see the full color of the Great Smokies. Thanks to the size of the park the night skies are very dark—especially during a new moon—which makes great astronomical images possible.\r\n\r\n$image:left/Places/SmokyMountains/FloatingSun.jpg$\r\n\r\nThis workshop is open to photographers of all skill levels and is limited to eight participants. There is no heavy hiking involved; we will be doing a lot of walking on paved roads as well as trails, but this is not a wilderness trek. To get the most out of this workshop you should be able to walk at least a few miles along easy terrain and expect to arise before dawn and stay out into the night each day.\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is _all-inclusive_, we are sorry that we cannot offer transportation.

The park spans a wide range of elevations, from 875 to 6,643 feet above sea level. The variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of animal and plant life. About 10,000 species are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 90,000 undocumented species may also be present.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is scheduled to coincide with the peak of fall color in the park as well as the new moon. Though it's difficult to predict the peak of foliage change precisely, the range of elevations in the park gives the photographer a good deal of \"wiggle room.\" Even if colors haven't peaked at 800 feet, odds are good that at over 3,000 feet you'll see the full color of the Great Smokies. Thanks to the size of the park the night skies are very dark—especially during a new moon—which makes great astronomical images possible.\r\n\r\n$image:left/Places/SmokyMountains/FloatingSun.jpg$\r\n\r\nThis workshop is open to photographers of all skill levels and is limited to eight participants. There is no heavy hiking involved; we will be doing a lot of walking on paved roads as well as trails, but this is not a wilderness trek. To get the most out of this workshop you should be able to walk at least a few miles along easy terrain and expect to arise before dawn and stay out into the night each day.\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is _all-inclusive_, we are sorry that we cannot offer transportation. The park has very tight roads and at times we'll be driving on unpaved passages, which would be clumsy for a large van. We'll make our best efforts to organize carpools, but you should be prepared to \"play it by ear\" or to caravan in your own vehicle.\r\n\r\nAs with all of our workshops, each person will be given a National Geographic park map, a two-way radio, and a generous package of information on the history, geography, and climate of the national park as well as photography tips and guidelines to use during the workshop and in the future.\r\n\r\nh2. Itinerary\r\n\r\nOctober 25th\r\n\r\nWe'll meet late in the day in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. You may drive to Gatlinburg directly or fly into Knoxville, Tennessee. We'll have introductions at dinner that evening.\r\n\r\nh3. October 26th-29th\r\n\r\n$image:right/Places/SmokyMountains/GoldMorning.jpg$\r\n\r\nFrom our hotel we'll make two trips daily into the park: one before dawn to photograph from the first light of day until mid-morning, and a second trip a few hours before the sun goes down to capture sunset and then move to another location for astronomical and night photography.\r\n\r\nEach day we will have opportunities to photograph the abundant wildlife in the park including deer, black bears, birds, and more. We'll take you to the best locations to capture beautiful landscapes and make sure you're in the best places at the best times. For example, we will walk into Cades Cove—a lush valley surrounded by mountains and a popular destination—just before dawn to capture the best light of day while tourists in their cars wait for the gate to be unlocked and miss out on all the good stuff!\r\n\r\nSome of the locations we'll photograph are:\r\n\r\n* Cades Cove\r\n* Clingman's Dome\r\n* Laurel Falls\r\n* New Found Gap Road\r\n* Mingus Mill\r\n\r\nh3. October 30th\r\n\r\nWe may make a last trip into the park to pick up any sights we haven't yet seen, and then it's farewell.

  Session ID: 13cfc221f3f04a7a6a7861534c05b87b
  Parameters: {"action"=>"edit", "id"=>"7", "controller"=>"admin", "workshop"=>{"end_date"=>"2008-10-30", "name"=>"Great Smoky Mountains National Park", "start_date"=>"2008-10-25", "cost"=>"2990", "cutoff_date"=>"2008-09-25", "description"=>"$image:right/Places/SmokyMountains/CloudCover.jpg$\r\n\r\nCome join us in the autumn of 2008 to experience some of the most beautiful landscapes in America at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\r\n\r\nThe park straddles the border between Tennessee and North Carolina, connected at the south end to the beautiful Blue Ridge Parkway. The park spans a wide range of elevations, from 875 to 6,643 feet above sea level. The variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of animal and plant life. About 10,000 species are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 90,000 undocumented species may also be present.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is scheduled to coincide with the peak of fall color in the park as well as the new moon. Though it's difficult to predict the peak of foliage change precisely, the range of elevations in the park gives the photographer a good deal of \"wiggle room.\" Even if colors haven't peaked at 800 feet, odds are good that at over 3,000 feet you'll see the full color of the Great Smokies. Thanks to the size of the park the night skies are very dark—especially during a new moon—which makes great astronomical images possible.\r\n\r\n$image:left/Places/SmokyMountains/FloatingSun.jpg$\r\n\r\nThis workshop is open to photographers of all skill levels and is limited to eight participants. There is no heavy hiking involved; we will be doing a lot of walking on paved roads as well as trails, but this is not a wilderness trek. To get the most out of this workshop you should be able to walk at least a few miles along easy terrain and expect to arise before dawn and stay out into the night each day.\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is _all-inclusive_, we are sorry that we cannot offer transportation. The park has very tight roads and at times we'll be driving on unpaved passages, which would be clumsy for a large van. We'll make our best efforts to organize carpools, but you should be prepared to \"play it by ear\" or to caravan in your own vehicle.\r\n\r\nAs with all of our workshops, each person will be given a National Geographic park map, a two-way radio, and a generous package of information on the history, geography, and climate of the national park as well as photography tips and guidelines to use during the workshop and in the future.\r\n\r\nh2. Itinerary\r\n\r\nOctober 25th\r\n\r\nWe'll meet late in the day in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. You may drive to Gatlinburg directly or fly into Knoxville, Tennessee. We'll have introductions at dinner that evening.\r\n\r\nh3. October 26th-29th\r\n\r\n$image:right/Places/SmokyMountains/GoldMorning.jpg$\r\n\r\nFrom our hotel we'll make two trips daily into the park: one before dawn to photograph from the first light of day until mid-morning, and a second trip a few hours before the sun goes down to capture sunset and then move to another location for astronomical and night photography.\r\n\r\nEach day we will have opportunities to photograph the abundant wildlife in the park including deer, black bears, birds, and more. We'll take you to the best locations to capture beautiful landscapes and make sure you're in the best places at the best times. For example, we will walk into Cades Cove—a lush valley surrounded by mountains and a popular destination—just before dawn to capture the best light of day while tourists in their cars wait for the gate to be unlocked and miss out on all the good stuff!\r\n\r\nSome of the locations we'll photograph are:\r\n\r\n* Cades Cove\r\n* Clingman's Dome\r\n* Laurel Falls\r\n* New Found Gap Road\r\n* Mingus Mill\r\n\r\nh3. October 30th\r\n\r\nWe may make a last trip into the park to pick up any sights we haven't yet seen, and then it's farewell.

  Parameters: {"action"=>"edit", "id"=>"7", "controller"=>"admin", "workshop"=>{"end_date"=>"2008-10-30", "name"=>"Great Smoky Mountains National Park", "start_date"=>"2008-10-25", "cost"=>"2990", "cutoff_date"=>"2008-09-25", "description"=>"$image:right/Places/SmokyMountains/CloudCover.jpg$\r\n\r\nCome join us in the autumn of 2008 to experience some of the most beautiful landscapes in America at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\r\n\r\nThe park straddles the border between Tennessee and North Carolina, connected at the south end to the beautiful Blue Ridge Parkway. The park spans a wide range of elevations, from 875 to 6,643 feet above sea level. The variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of animal and plant life. About 10,000 species are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 90,000 undocumented species may also be present.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is scheduled to coincide with the peak of fall color in the park as well as the new moon. Though it's difficult to predict the peak of foliage change precisely, the range of elevations in the park gives the photographer a good deal of \"wiggle room.\" Even if colors haven't peaked at 800 feet, odds are good that at over 3,000 feet you'll see the full color of the Great Smokies. Thanks to the size of the park the night skies are very dark—especially during a new moon—which makes great astronomical images possible.\r\n\r\n$image:left/Places/SmokyMountains/FloatingSun.jpg$\r\n\r\nThis workshop is open to photographers of all skill levels and is limited to eight participants. There is no heavy hiking involved; we will be doing a lot of walking on paved roads as well as trails, but this is not a wilderness trek. To get the most out of this workshop you should be able to walk at least a few miles along easy terrain and expect to arise before dawn and stay out into the night each day.\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is _all-inclusive_, we are sorry that we cannot offer transportation. The park has very tight roads and at times we'll be driving on unpaved passages, which would be clumsy for a large van. We'll make our best efforts to organize carpools, but you should be prepared to \"play it by ear\" or to caravan in your own vehicle.\r\n\r\nAs with all of our workshops, each person will be given a National Geographic park map, a two-way radio, and a generous package of information on the history, geography, and climate of the national park as well as photography tips and guidelines to use during the workshop and in the future.\r\n\r\nh2. Itinerary\r\n\r\nOctober 25th\r\n\r\nWe'll meet late in the day in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. You may drive to Gatlinburg directly or fly into Knoxville, Tennessee. We'll have introductions at dinner that evening.\r\n\r\nh3. October 26th-29th\r\n\r\n$image:right/Places/SmokyMountains/GoldMorning.jpg$\r\n\r\nFrom our hotel we'll make two trips daily into the park: one before dawn to photograph from the first light of day until mid-morning, and a second trip a few hours before the sun goes down to capture sunset and then move to another location for astronomical and night photography.\r\n\r\nEach day we will have opportunities to photograph the abundant wildlife in the park including deer, black bears, birds, and more. We'll take you to the best locations to capture beautiful landscapes and make sure you're in the best places at the best times. For example, we will walk into Cades Cove—a lush valley surrounded by mountains and a popular destination—just before dawn to capture the best light of day while tourists in their cars wait for the gate to be unlocked and miss out on all the good stuff!\r\n\r\nSome of the locations we'll photograph are:\r\n\r\n* Cades Cove\r\n* Clingman's Dome\r\n* Laurel Falls\r\n* New Found Gap Road\r\n* Mingus Mill\r\n\r\nh3.

The park spans a wide range of elevations, from 875 to 6,643 feet above sea level. The variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of animal and plant life. About 10,000 species are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 90,000 undocumented species may also be present.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is scheduled to coincide with the peak of fall color in the park as well as the new moon. Though it's difficult to predict the peak of foliage change precisely, the range of elevations in the park gives the photographer a good deal of \"wiggle room.\" Even if colors haven't peaked at 800 feet, odds are good that at over 3,000 feet you'll see the full color of the Great Smokies. Thanks to the size of the park the night skies are very dark—especially during a new moon—which makes great astronomical images possible.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"one-image align-left\" style=\"float: left;\">\r\n  \r\n                              \r\n          <a href=\"http://www.fisheyegallery.com/Places/SmokyMountains/FloatingSun.jpg.html\" >\r\n  \r\n\t<img src=\"http://www.fisheyegallery.com/d/544-2/FloatingSun.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" id=\"IFid1\" class=\"ImageFrame_solid\" alt=\"Floating Sun\" longdesc=\"\"/>\r\n      </a>\r\n    \r\n\r\n  \r\n      <h4 class=\"giDescription\">\r\n      Floating Sun\r\n    </h4>\r\n  \r\n   </div>\r\n \r\nThis workshop is open to photographers of all skill levels and is limited to eight participants. There is no heavy hiking involved; we will be doing a lot of walking on paved roads as well as trails, but this is not a wilderness trek. To get the most out of this workshop you should be able to walk at least a few miles along easy terrain and expect to arise before dawn and stay out into the night each day.\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is _all-inclusive_, we are sorry that we cannot offer transportation. The park has very tight roads and at times we'll be driving on unpaved passages, which would be clumsy for a large van. We'll make our best efforts to organize carpools, but you should be prepared to \"play it by ear\" or to caravan in your own vehicle.\r\n\r\nAs with all of our workshops, each person will be given a National Geographic park map, a two-way radio, and a generous package of information on the history, geography, and climate of the national park as well as photography tips and guidelines to use during the workshop and in the future.\r\n\r\nh2. Itinerary\r\n\r\nOctober 25th\r\n\r\nWe'll meet late in the day in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. You may drive to Gatlinburg directly or fly into Knoxville, Tennessee. We'll have introductions at dinner that evening.\r\n\r\nh3.

We'll take you to the best locations to capture beautiful landscapes and make sure you're in the best places at the best times. For example, we will walk into Cades Cove—a lush valley surrounded by mountains and a popular destination—just before dawn to capture the best light of day while tourists in their cars wait for the gate to be unlocked and miss out on all the good stuff!\r\n\r\nSome of the locations we'll photograph are:\r\n\r\n* Cades Cove\r\n* Clingman's Dome\r\n* Laurel Falls\r\n* New Found Gap Road\r\n* Mingus Mill\r\n\r\nh3.

The park spans a wide range of elevations, from 875 to 6,643 feet above sea level. The variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of animal and plant life. About 10,000 species are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 90,000 undocumented species may also be present.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is scheduled to coincide with the peak of fall color in the park as well as the new moon. Though it's difficult to predict the peak of foliage change precisely, the range of elevations in the park gives the photographer a good deal of \"wiggle room.\" Even if colors haven't peaked at 800 feet, odds are good that at over 3,000 feet you'll see the full color of the Great Smokies. Thanks to the size of the park the night skies are very dark—especially during a new moon—which makes great astronomical images possible.\r\n\r\n$image:left/Places/SmokyMountains/FloatingSun.jpg$\r\n\r\nThis workshop is open to photographers of all skill levels and is limited to eight participants. There is no heavy hiking involved; we will be doing a lot of walking on paved roads as well as trails, but this is not a wilderness trek. To get the most out of this workshop you should be able to walk at least a few miles along easy terrain and expect to arise before dawn and stay out into the night each day.\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is _all-inclusive_, we are sorry that we cannot offer transportation. The park has very tight roads and at times we'll be driving on unpaved passages, which would be clumsy for a large van. We'll make our best efforts to organize carpools, but you should be prepared to \"play it by ear\" or to caravan in your own vehicle.\r\n\r\nAs with all of our workshops, each person will be given a National Geographic park map, a two-way radio, and a generous package of information on the history, geography, and climate of the national park as well as photography tips and guidelines to use during the workshop and in the future.\r\n\r\nh2. Itinerary\r\n\r\nOctober 25th\r\n\r\nWe'll meet late in the day in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. You may drive to Gatlinburg directly or fly into Knoxville, Tennessee. We'll have introductions at dinner that evening.\r\n\r\nh3. October 26th-29th\r\n\r\n$image:right/Places/SmokyMountains/GoldMorning.jpg$\r\n\r\nFrom our hotel we'll make two trips daily into the park: one before dawn to photograph from the first light of day until mid-morning, and a second trip a few hours before the sun goes down to capture sunset and then move to another location for astronomical and night photography.\r\n\r\nEach day we will have opportunities to photograph the abundant wildlife in the park including deer, black bears, birds, and more. We'll take you to the best locations to capture beautiful landscapes and make sure you're in the best places at the best times. For example, we will walk into Cades Cove—a lush valley surrounded by mountains and a popular destination—just before dawn to capture the best light of day while tourists in their cars wait for the gate to be unlocked and miss out on all the good stuff!\r\n\r\nSome of the locations we'll photograph are:\r\n\r\n* Cades Cove\r\n* Clingman's Dome\r\n* Laurel Falls\r\n* New Found Gap Road\r\n* Mingus Mill\r\n\r\nh3.

The park spans a wide range of elevations, from 875 to 6,643 feet above sea level. The variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of animal and plant life. About 10,000 species are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 90,000 undocumented species may also be present.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is scheduled to coincide with the peak of fall color in the park as well as the new moon. Though it's difficult to predict the peak of foliage change precisely, the range of elevations in the park gives the photographer a good deal of \"wiggle room.\" Even if colors haven't peaked at 800 feet, odds are good that at over 3,000 feet you'll see the full color of the Great Smokies. Thanks to the size of the park the night skies are very dark—especially during a new moon—which makes great astronomical images possible.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"one-image align-left\" style=\"float: left;\">\r\n  \r\n                              \r\n          <a href=\"http://www.fisheyegallery.com/Places/SmokyMountains/FloatingSun.jpg.html\" >\r\n  \r\n\t<img src=\"http://www.fisheyegallery.com/d/544-2/FloatingSun.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" id=\"IFid1\" class=\"ImageFrame_solid\" alt=\"Floating Sun\" longdesc=\"\"/>\r\n      </a>\r\n    \r\n\r\n  \r\n      <h4 class=\"giDescription\">\r\n      Floating Sun\r\n    </h4>\r\n  \r\n   </div>\r\n \r\nThis workshop is open to photographers of all skill levels and is limited to eight participants. There is no heavy hiking involved; we will be doing a lot of walking on paved roads as well as trails, but this is not a wilderness trek. To get the most out of this workshop you should be able to walk at least a few miles along easy terrain and expect to arise before dawn and stay out into the night each day.\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is _all-inclusive_, we are sorry that we cannot offer transportation. The park has very tight roads and at times we'll be driving on unpaved passages, which would be clumsy for a large van. We'll make our best efforts to organize carpools, but you should be prepared to \"play it by ear\" or to caravan in your own vehicle.\r\n\r\nAs with all of our workshops, each person will be given a National Geographic park map, a two-way radio, and a generous package of information on the history, geography, and climate of the national park as well as photography tips and guidelines to use during the workshop and in the future.\r\n\r\nh2. Itinerary\r\n\r\nOctober 25th\r\n\r\nWe'll meet late in the day in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. You may drive to Gatlinburg directly or fly into Knoxville, Tennessee.

We'll take you to the best locations to capture beautiful landscapes and make sure you're in the best places at the best times. For example, we will walk into Cades Cove—a lush valley surrounded by mountains and a popular destination—just before dawn to capture the best light of day while tourists in their cars wait for the gate to be unlocked and miss out on all the good stuff!\r\n\r\nSome of the locations we'll photograph are:\r\n\r\n* Cades Cove\r\n* Clingman's Dome\r\n* Laurel Falls\r\n* New Found Gap Road\r\n* Mingus Mill\r\n\r\nh3.

The park spans a wide range of elevations, from 875 to 6,643 feet above sea level. The variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of animal and plant life. About 10,000 species are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 90,000 undocumented species may also be present.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is scheduled to coincide with the peak of fall color in the park as well as the new moon. Though it's difficult to predict the peak of foliage change precisely, the range of elevations in the park gives the photographer a good deal of \"wiggle room.\" Even if colors haven't peaked at 800 feet, odds are good that at over 3,000 feet you'll see the full color of the Great Smokies. Thanks to the size of the park the night skies are very dark—especially during a new moon—which makes great astronomical images possible.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"one-image align-left\" style=\"float: left;\">\r\n  \r\n                              \r\n          <a href=\"http://www.fisheyegallery.com/Places/SmokyMountains/FloatingSun.jpg.html\" >\r\n  \r\n\t<img src=\"http://www.fisheyegallery.com/d/544-2/FloatingSun.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" id=\"IFid1\" class=\"ImageFrame_solid\" alt=\"Floating Sun\" longdesc=\"\"/>\r\n      </a>\r\n    \r\n\r\n  \r\n      <h4 class=\"giDescription\">\r\n      Floating Sun\r\n    </h4>\r\n  \r\n   </div>\r\n \r\nThis workshop is open to photographers of all skill levels and is limited to eight participants. There is no heavy hiking involved; we will be doing a lot of walking on paved roads as well as trails, but this is not a wilderness trek. To get the most out of this workshop you should be able to walk at least a few miles along easy terrain and expect to arise before dawn and stay out into the night each day.\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is _all-inclusive_, we are sorry that we cannot offer transportation. The park has very tight roads and at times we'll be driving on unpaved passages, which would be clumsy for a large van. We'll make our best efforts to organize carpools, but you should be prepared to \"play it by ear\" or to caravan in your own vehicle.\r\n\r\nAs with all of our workshops, each person will be given a National Geographic park map, a two-way radio, and a generous package of information on the history, geography, and climate of the national park as well as photography tips and guidelines to use during the workshop and in the future.\r\n\r\nh2. Itinerary\r\n\r\nOctober 25th\r\n\r\nWe'll meet late in the day in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. You may drive to Gatlinburg directly or fly into Knoxville, Tennessee. We'll have introductions at dinner that evening.\r\n\r\nh3. October 26th-29th\r\n\r\n<div class=\"one-image align-right\" style=\"float: right;\">\r\n  \r\n                              \r\n          <a href=\"http://www.fisheyegallery.com/Places/SmokyMountains/GoldMorning.jpg.html\" >\r\n  \r\n\t<img src=\"http://www.fisheyegallery.com/d/548-2/GoldMorning.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\" id=\"IFid1\" class=\"ImageFrame_solid\" alt=\"Gold Morning\" longdesc=\"\"/>\r\n      </a>\r\n    \r\n\r\n  \r\n      <h4 class=\"giDescription\">\r\n      Gold Morning\r\n    </h4>\r\n  \r\n   </div>\r\n \r\nFrom our hotel we'll make two trips daily into the park: one before dawn to photograph from the first light of day until mid-morning, and a second trip a few hours before the sun goes down to capture sunset and then move to another location for astronomical and night photography.\r\n\r\nEach day we will have opportunities to photograph the abundant wildlife in the park including deer, black bears, birds, and more. We'll take you to the best locations to capture beautiful landscapes and make sure you're in the best places at the best times. For example, we will walk into Cades Cove—a lush valley surrounded by mountains and a popular destination—just before dawn to capture the best light of day while tourists in their cars wait for the gate to be unlocked and miss out on all the good stuff!\r\n\r\nSome of the locations we'll photograph are:\r\n\r\n* Cades Cove\r\n* Clingman's Dome\r\n* Laurel Falls\r\n* New Found Gap Road\r\n* Mingus Mill\r\n\r\nh3. October 30th\r\n\r\nWe may make a last trip into the park to pick up any sights we haven't yet seen, and then it's farewell.

This workshop is designed to coincide with the new moon, giving us nights filled with stars. If you have never done photography at night before, or if you want to get better at it, this is the right workshop for you. Between the two of us we have 12 years of experience making wonderful images at night. \r\n\r\n$image:right/Places/DeathValley/Tendrils.jpg$\r\n\r\nThis workshop gives you the opportunity to photograph a famous and unique location with two professional photographers who will help you get the *most* out of every hour and out of every exposure.\r\n\r\nh2. Who should attend this workshop?\r\n\r\nAnyone who wants to advance their photography skills and get the absolute most out of a trip to Death Valley. In a limited amount of time we'll bring you to the best locations at the best times and work with you both in the field and in front of the computer to help you get great results.\r\n\r\nh2. Itinerary\r\n\r\nHere's the plan.\r\n\r\nh3. Friday April 4th\r\n\r\nWe will meet in the afternoon (you'll be emailed the exact time and place to meet at least two weeks prior to the workshop). Each participant will receive a workshop package including information and equipment (listed below). We will then have introductions, get to know one another, and get a feel for what each of you hope to accomplish during the workshop. We will set out in the early evening to photograph sunset and then do an introduction to night photography.\r\n\r\nh3. Saturday April 5th - Monday April 7th\r\n\r\nEach day of the workshop will be broken up into three sessions, described here:\r\n\r\n*Session 1 - Dawn*\r\n\r\nWe'll meet in an agreed upon location and set out to photograph dawn, then return to the inn for breakfast.\r\n\r\n*Session 2 - Late morning*\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we'll get together to review the work we've done so far, go over any  questions, and plan shooting locations for the remainder of the day. Participants who shoot digital and have a laptop with them are welcome to share their work with the group. Chris and Aaron will be available to do one-on-one critiques and offer guidance.\r\n\r\nThere are a few locations that can be effective during morning and afternoon sun, such as Golden Canyon, so we may opt to explore one of those locations together during the day. If you wish to explore on your own, you are welcome to.\r\n\r\n*Session 3 - Sunset*\r\n\r\nWe will travel to our chosen location to photograph sunset. After night falls, we will commence night photography sessions. It is not unusual for the ambitious in the group to photograph well into the night.\r\n\r\nNote: Some of you may not want to join us for the next sunrise session. You can meet us at breakfast, normally around 9-9:30 AM.\r\n\r\nSince the conditions in Death Valley change from day to day, it's impossible to predict the perfect location for each session. Both Chris and Aaron have a good deal of experience with Death Valley and will plan our locations to best fit the changing conditions. Our first priority is making great photographs, no matter what the circumstances.\r\n\r\nThough we will be photographing locations as a group, each will offer the opportunity to spread out across a large area. Two-way radios can come in handy, so we're going to give you one. It's an effective method for the group to communicate across distances of a mile or more, and we'll also use the radios to communicate between vehicles while traveling to each location.\r\n\r\nh2. Registration\r\n\r\nThe cost of this once-in-a-lifetime experience is only $1,199 and is open to photographers of all skill levels. To register, please \"send us an email\":mailto:dvworkshop@fisheyegallery.com. We accept all major credit cards as well as personal checks. After you contact us, we'll mail you our registration package. Workshops are filled on a first-come first-served basis, so don't miss out!\r\n\r\nWorkshop fees are refundable up to 60 days before the workshop, less 10% for processing fees. Within 60 days of the workshop a refund is not possible.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to e-mail us with any questions.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will have a maximum of ten participants. Sorry, but no guests are permitted to tag along. We find that the group is most focused and productive when we are all actively photographing, and we don't want to dilute the experience for any of our attendees.\r\n\r\nh3. Important Notes\r\n\r\n* This is not an all-inclusive trip and as such does not include transportation, food, or lodging. Your registration package will contain a thorough list of available hotels and campgrounds as well as our advice on staying in Death Valley.\r\n* Though meal cost is not included, we'll eat at the same time each day and you may wish to join us, or feel free to go out on your own during this time.\r\n* Your registration package will also include detailed information on the trip as well as a very basic questionnaire that we use to tailor the workshop for you.\r\n* We will not be taking any long hikes, but some hiking will be required. This is not a stressful amount of exercise by any means, but you should be in decent physical shape and able to navigate the irregular desert terrain.\r\n\r\nh2. Gear\r\n\r\nYou'll need some things on this trip...\r\n\r\nh3. What you should bring\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is open to all skill levels, you should have at least a 35mm SLR (digital or film) camera and a tripod. You should also have a basic understanding of how your camera works. We would be glad to help you get the most out of your equipment while on the workshop, but it won't be a fundamental course, so be sure you are familiar with the basics.\r\n\r\nIf you want to brush up or review, you may want to read these articles (posted here):\r\n\r\n* \"Histograms, Huh?\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/06/03/histograms-huh/\r\n* \"Be a Control Freak--Shooting Modes Explained\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/05/29/be-a-control-freak-shooting-modes-explained/\r\n* \"Focal Length Reciprocal Rule\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/05/22/focal-length-reciprocal-rule/\r\n\r\nAnd also these assorted articles from Earthbound Light Photography:\r\n\r\n* \"I Bought a Digital Camera But My Photos Are Still Blurry\":http://www.earthboundlight.com/phototips/digital-photography-still-photography.html\r\n* \"Program vs. Aperture Priority vs. Shutter Priority vs. Manual\":http://www.earthboundlight.com/phototips/program-aperture-shutter-priority-manual-exposure.html\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in advice on what to bring (or what to buy), you can \"email Chris\":mailto:cblake@curiouslens.com. He has a lot of equipment experience and would be happy to share it with you.\r\n\r\nThe weather in Death Valley can go from very warm to very cold. You should pack accordingly, keeping in mind that in windy conditions before dawn and after the sun goes down it can feel very cold.\r\n\r\nh3. What we will give you\r\n\r\nAs part of the workshop experience, we will provide you with a few essential items that we have found to be indispensable on these trips.  The Death Valley Workshop package includes a GMRS(General Mobile Radio Service) (family band) two-way radio with several-mile range; a bright xenon flashlight for light painting and general navigation; a rugged, waterproof National Geographic map of the park that we will refer to often; and lots of information about the art and science of photographing on location and specifically in Death Valley. All of these items are, of course, yours to keep.\r\n\r\nh2. Who are you?\r\n\r\nHere's a little about us and why you're going to love to learn and explore with us in Death Valley.\r\n\r\nh3. Christopher Blake\r\n\r\nI am a fine art travel photographer living in the Boston area. I have worked exclusively with digital cameras for the past six years, focusing on traditional fine art landscapes, HDR (high dynamic range), and night photography. I have an extensive background in information technology and I leverage that knowledge to get the most out of my photographs. I am excited to share my experience in travel photography with you in Death Valley!\r\n\r\nView Chris's gallery, \"The Curious Lens\":http://www.curiouslens.com.\r\n\r\nh3. Aaron Bieber\r\n\r\nI am an illustrator, photographer, web and graphic designer living and working on the scenic Connecticut coast (I am also the author of this blog). Though I have been very serious about photography for many years, I come from a traditional art background and I have written at length on the topics of photography as an art form and the techniques and practices unique to photography as a medium for artistic expression. My main interests in photography are geometric abstractions and exploring the invisible world as can only be seen through the lens of a camera.\r\n\r\nWith over ten years of Photoshop experience and as an outspoken fan of Photoshop Lightroom, I do my best work in post-production. I look forward to helping you make the most of a very unique experience during this workshop!\r\n\r\nView Aaron's gallery, \"Fisheye Multimedia Galleries\":http://www.fisheyegallery.com", "short_name"=>"DeathValley", "max_students"=>"1"}, "preview"=>"Preview", "object"=>"workshop"}

What you should bring\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is open to all skill levels, you should have at least a 35mm SLR (digital or film) camera and a tripod. You should also have a basic understanding of how your camera works. We would be glad to help you get the most out of your equipment while on the workshop, but it won't be a fundamental course, so be sure you are familiar with the basics.\r\n\r\nIf you want to brush up or review, you may want to read these articles (posted here):\r\n\r\n* \"Histograms, Huh?\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/06/03/histograms-huh/\r\n* \"Be a Control Freak--Shooting Modes Explained\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/05/29/be-a-control-freak-shooting-modes-explained/\r\n* \"Focal Length Reciprocal Rule\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/05/22/focal-length-reciprocal-rule/\r\n\r\nAnd also these assorted articles from Earthbound Light Photography:\r\n\r\n* \"I Bought a Digital Camera But My Photos Are Still Blurry\":http://www.earthboundlight.com/phototips/digital-photography-still-photography.html\r\n* \"Program vs. Aperture Priority vs. Shutter Priority vs. Manual\":http://www.earthboundlight.com/phototips/program-aperture-shutter-priority-manual-exposure.html\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in advice on what to bring (or what to buy), you can \"email Chris\":mailto:cblake@curiouslens.com. He has a lot of equipment experience and would be happy to share it with you.\r\n\r\nThe weather in Death Valley can go from very warm to very cold. You should pack accordingly, keeping in mind that in windy conditions before dawn and after the sun goes down it can feel very cold.\r\n\r\nh3. What we will give you\r\n\r\nAs part of the workshop experience, we will provide you with a few essential items that we have found to be indispensable on these trips.  The Death Valley Workshop package includes a GMRS(General Mobile Radio Service) (family band) two-way radio with several-mile range; a bright xenon flashlight for light painting and general navigation; a rugged, waterproof National Geographic map of the park that we will refer to often; and lots of information about the art and science of photographing on location and specifically in Death Valley. All of these items are, of course, yours to keep.\r\n\r\nh2. Who are you?\r\n\r\nHere's a little about us and why you're going to love to learn and explore with us in Death Valley.\r\n\r\nh3. Christopher Blake\r\n\r\nI am a fine art travel photographer living in the Boston area. I have worked exclusively with digital cameras for the past six years, focusing on traditional fine art landscapes, HDR (high dynamic range), and night photography. I have an extensive background in information technology and I leverage that knowledge to get the most out of my photographs. I am excited to share my experience in travel photography with you in Death Valley!\r\n\r\nView Chris's gallery, \"The Curious Lens\":http://www.curiouslens.com.\r\n\r\nh3. Aaron Bieber\r\n\r\nI am an illustrator, photographer, web and graphic designer living and working on the scenic Connecticut coast (I am also the author of this blog). Though I have been very serious about photography for many years, I come from a traditional art background and I have written at length on the topics of photography as an art form and the techniques and practices unique to photography as a medium for artistic expression. My main interests in photography are geometric abstractions and exploring the invisible world as can only be seen through the lens of a camera.\r\n\r\nWith over ten years of Photoshop experience and as an outspoken fan of Photoshop Lightroom, I do my best work in post-production. I look forward to helping you make the most of a very unique experience during this workshop!\r\n\r\nView Aaron's gallery, \"Fisheye Multimedia Galleries\":http://www.fisheyegallery.com", "short_name"=>"DeathValley", "max_students"=>"1"}, "preview"=>"Preview", "object"=>"workshop"}

  Parameters: {"action"=>"edit", "id"=>"7", "controller"=>"admin", "workshop"=>{"end_date"=>"2008-10-30", "name"=>"Great Smoky Mountains National Park", "start_date"=>"2008-10-25", "cost"=>"2990", "cutoff_date"=>"2008-09-25", "description"=>"$image:right/Places/SmokyMountains/CloudCover.jpg$\r\n\r\nCome join us in the autumn of 2008 to experience some of the most beautiful landscapes in America at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\r\n\r\nThe park straddles the border between Tennessee and North Carolina, connected at the south end to the beautiful Blue Ridge Parkway. The park spans a wide range of elevations, from 875 to 6,643 feet above sea level. The variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of animal and plant life. About 10,000 species are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 90,000 undocumented species may also be present.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is scheduled to coincide with the peak of fall color in the park as well as the new moon. Though it's difficult to predict the peak of foliage change precisely, the range of elevations in the park gives the photographer a good deal of \"wiggle room.\" Even if colors haven't peaked at 800 feet, odds are good that at over 3,000 feet you'll see the full color of the Great Smokies. Thanks to the size of the park the night skies are very dark—especially during a new moon—which makes great astronomical images possible.\r\n\r\n$image:left/Places/SmokyMountains/FloatingSun.jpg$\r\n\r\nThis workshop is open to photographers of all skill levels and is limited to eight participants. There is no heavy hiking involved; we will be doing a lot of walking on paved roads as well as trails, but this is not a wilderness trek. To get the most out of this workshop you should be able to walk at least a few miles along easy terrain and expect to arise before dawn and stay out into the night each day.\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is _all-inclusive_, we are sorry that we cannot offer transportation. The park has very tight roads and at times we'll be driving on unpaved passages, which would be clumsy for a large van. We'll make our best efforts to organize carpools, but you should be prepared to \"play it by ear\" or to caravan in your own vehicle.\r\n\r\nAs with all of our workshops, each person will be given a National Geographic park map, a two-way radio, and a generous package of information on the history, geography, and climate of the national park as well as photography tips and guidelines to use during the workshop and in the future.\r\n\r\nh2. Itinerary\r\n\r\nOctober 25th\r\n\r\nWe'll meet late in the day in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. You may drive to Gatlinburg directly or fly into Knoxville, Tennessee.

October 26th-29th\r\n\r\n$image:right/Places/SmokyMountains/GoldMorning.jpg$\r\n\r\nFrom our hotel we'll make two trips daily into the park: one before dawn to photograph from the first light of day until mid-morning, and a second trip a few hours before the sun goes down to capture sunset and then move to another location for astronomical and night photography.\r\n\r\nEach day we will have opportunities to photograph the abundant wildlife in the park including deer, black bears, birds, and more. We'll take you to the best locations to capture beautiful landscapes and make sure you're in the best places at the best times. For example, we will walk into Cades Cove—a lush valley surrounded by mountains and a popular destination—just before dawn to capture the best light of day while tourists in their cars wait for the gate to be unlocked and miss out on all the good stuff!\r\n\r\nSome of the locations we'll photograph are:\r\n\r\n* Cades Cove\r\n* Clingman's Dome\r\n* Laurel Falls\r\n* New Found Gap Road\r\n* Mingus Mill\r\n\r\nh3.

The park spans a wide range of elevations, from 875 to 6,643 feet above sea level. The variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of animal and plant life. About 10,000 species are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 90,000 undocumented species may also be present.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is scheduled to coincide with the peak of fall color in the park as well as the new moon. Though it's difficult to predict the peak of foliage change precisely, the range of elevations in the park gives the photographer a good deal of \"wiggle room.\" Even if colors haven't peaked at 800 feet, odds are good that at over 3,000 feet you'll see the full color of the Great Smokies. Thanks to the size of the park the night skies are very dark—especially during a new moon—which makes great astronomical images possible.\r\n\r\n$image:left/Places/SmokyMountains/FloatingSun.jpg$\r\n\r\nThis workshop is open to photographers of all skill levels and is limited to eight participants. There is no heavy hiking involved; we will be doing a lot of walking on paved roads as well as trails, but this is not a wilderness trek. To get the most out of this workshop you should be able to walk at least a few miles along easy terrain and expect to arise before dawn and stay out into the night each day.\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is _all-inclusive_, we are sorry that we cannot offer transportation. The park has very tight roads and at times we'll be driving on unpaved passages, which would be clumsy for a large van. We'll make our best efforts to organize carpools, but you should be prepared to \"play it by ear\" or to caravan in your own vehicle.\r\n\r\nAs with all of our workshops, each person will be given a National Geographic park map, a two-way radio, and a generous package of information on the history, geography, and climate of the national park as well as photography tips and guidelines to use during the workshop and in the future.\r\n\r\nh2.

The park spans a wide range of elevations, from 875 to 6,643 feet above sea level. The variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of animal and plant life. About 10,000 species are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 90,000 undocumented species may also be present.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is scheduled to coincide with the peak of fall color in the park as well as the new moon. Though it's difficult to predict the peak of foliage change precisely, the range of elevations in the park gives the photographer a good deal of \"wiggle room.\" Even if colors haven't peaked at 800 feet, odds are good that at over 3,000 feet you'll see the full color of the Great Smokies. Thanks to the size of the park the night skies are very dark—especially during a new moon—which makes great astronomical images possible.\r\n\r\n$image:left/Places/SmokyMountains/FloatingSun.jpg$\r\n\r\nThis workshop is open to photographers of all skill levels and is limited to eight participants. There is no heavy hiking involved; we will be doing a lot of walking on paved roads as well as trails, but this is not a wilderness trek. To get the most out of this workshop you should be able to walk at least a few miles along easy terrain and expect to arise before dawn and stay out into the night each day.\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is _all-inclusive_, we are sorry that we cannot offer transportation. The park has very tight roads and at times we'll be driving on unpaved passages, which would be clumsy for a large van. We'll make our best efforts to organize carpools, but you should be prepared to \"play it by ear\" or to caravan in your own vehicle.\r\n\r\nAs with all of our workshops, each person will be given a National Geographic park map, a two-way radio, and a generous package of information on the history, geography, and climate of the national park as well as photography tips and guidelines to use during the workshop and in the future.\r\n\r\nh2. Itinerary\r\n\r\nOctober 25th\r\n\r\nWe'll meet late in the day in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. You may drive to Gatlinburg directly or fly into Knoxville, Tennessee.

We'll take you to the best locations to capture beautiful landscapes and make sure you're in the best places at the best times. For example, we will walk into Cades Cove—a lush valley surrounded by mountains and a popular destination—just before dawn to capture the best light of day while tourists in their cars wait for the gate to be unlocked and miss out on all the good stuff!\r\n\r\nSome of the locations we'll photograph are:\r\n\r\n* Cades Cove\r\n* Clingman's Dome\r\n* Laurel Falls\r\n* New Found Gap Road\r\n* Mingus Mill\r\n\r\nh3.

Blake)$\r\n\r\nCome join us in the autumn of 2008 to experience some of the most beautiful landscapes in America at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\r\n\r\nThe park straddles the border between Tennessee and North Carolina, connected at the south end to the beautiful Blue Ridge Parkway. The park spans a wide range of elevations, from 875 to 6,643 feet above sea level. The variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of animal and plant life. About 10,000 species are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 90,000 undocumented species may also be present.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is scheduled to coincide with the peak of fall color in the park as well as the new moon. Though it's difficult to predict the peak of foliage change precisely, the range of elevations in the park gives the photographer a good deal of \"wiggle room.\" Even if colors haven't peaked at 800 feet, odds are good that at over 3,000 feet you'll see the full color of the Great Smokies. Thanks to the size of the park the night skies are very dark—especially during a new moon—which makes great astronomical images possible.\r\n\r\n$image:left/Places/SmokyMountains/FloatingSun.jpg$\r\n\r\nThis workshop is open to photographers of all skill levels and is limited to eight participants. There is no heavy hiking involved; we will be doing a lot of walking on paved roads as well as trails, but this is not a wilderness trek. To get the most out of this workshop you should be able to walk at least a few miles along easy terrain and expect to arise before dawn and stay out into the night each day.\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is _all-inclusive_, we are sorry that we cannot offer transportation. The park has very tight roads and at times we'll be driving on unpaved passages, which would be clumsy for a large van. We'll make our best efforts to organize carpools, but you should be prepared to \"play it by ear\" or to caravan in your own vehicle.\r\n\r\nAs with all of our workshops, each person will be given a National Geographic park map, a two-way radio, and a generous package of information on the history, geography, and climate of the national park as well as photography tips and guidelines to use during the workshop and in the future.\r\n\r\nh2. Itinerary\r\n\r\nOctober 25th\r\n\r\nWe'll meet late in the day in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. You may drive to Gatlinburg directly or fly into Knoxville, Tennessee. We'll have introductions at dinner that evening.\r\n\r\nh3. October 26th-29th\r\n\r\n$image:right/Places/SmokyMountains/GoldMorning.jpg$\r\n\r\nFrom our hotel we'll make two trips daily into the park: one before dawn to photograph from the first light of day until mid-morning, and a second trip a few hours before the sun goes down to capture sunset and then move to another location for astronomical and night photography.\r\n\r\nEach day we will have opportunities to photograph the abundant wildlife in the park including deer, black bears, birds, and more. We'll take you to the best locations to capture beautiful landscapes and make sure you're in the best places at the best times. For example, we will walk into Cades Cove—a lush valley surrounded by mountains and a popular destination—just before dawn to capture the best light of day while tourists in their cars wait for the gate to be unlocked and miss out on all the good stuff!\r\n\r\nSome of the locations we'll photograph are:\r\n\r\n* Cades Cove\r\n* Clingman's Dome\r\n* Laurel Falls\r\n* New Found Gap Road\r\n* Mingus Mill\r\n\r\nh3. October 30th\r\n\r\nWe may make a last trip into the park to pick up any sights we haven't yet seen, and then it's farewell.

The park spans a wide range of elevations, from 875 to 6,643 feet above sea level. The variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of animal and plant life. About 10,000 species are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 90,000 undocumented species may also be present.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is scheduled to coincide with the peak of fall color in the park as well as the new moon. Though it's difficult to predict the peak of foliage change precisely, the range of elevations in the park gives the photographer a good deal of \"wiggle room.\" Even if colors haven't peaked at 800 feet, odds are good that at over 3,000 feet you'll see the full color of the Great Smokies. Thanks to the size of the park the night skies are very dark—especially during a new moon—which makes great astronomical images possible.\r\n\r\n$image:left/Places/SmokyMountains/FloatingSun.jpg$\r\n\r\nThis workshop is open to photographers of all skill levels and is limited to eight participants. There is no heavy hiking involved; we will be doing a lot of walking on paved roads as well as trails, but this is not a wilderness trek. To get the most out of this workshop you should be able to walk at least a few miles along easy terrain and expect to arise before dawn and stay out into the night each day.\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is _all-inclusive_, we are sorry that we cannot offer transportation. The park has very tight roads and at times we'll be driving on unpaved passages, which would be clumsy for a large van. We'll make our best efforts to organize carpools, but you should be prepared to \"play it by ear\" or to caravan in your own vehicle.\r\n\r\nAs with all of our workshops, each person will be given a National Geographic park map, a two-way radio, and a generous package of information on the history, geography, and climate of the national park as well as photography tips and guidelines to use during the workshop and in the future.\r\n\r\nh2.

  Parameters: {"action"=>"edit", "id"=>"7", "controller"=>"admin", "workshop"=>{"end_date"=>"2008-10-30", "name"=>"Great Smoky Mountains National Park", "start_date"=>"2008-10-25", "cost"=>"2990", "cutoff_date"=>"2008-09-25", "description"=>"$image:right/Places/SmokyMountains/CloudCover.jpg$\r\n\r\nCome join us in the autumn of 2008 to experience some of the most beautiful landscapes in America at the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\r\n\r\nThe park straddles the border between Tennessee and North Carolina, connected at the south end to the beautiful Blue Ridge Parkway. The park spans a wide range of elevations, from 875 to 6,643 feet above sea level. The variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of animal and plant life. About 10,000 species are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 90,000 undocumented species may also be present.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is scheduled to coincide with the peak of fall color in the park as well as the new moon. Though it's difficult to predict the peak of foliage change precisely, the range of elevations in the park gives the photographer a good deal of \"wiggle room.\" Even if colors haven't peaked at 800 feet, odds are good that at over 3,000 feet you'll see the full color of the Great Smokies. Thanks to the size of the park the night skies are very dark—especially during a new moon—which makes great astronomical images possible.\r\n\r\n$image:left/Places/SmokyMountains/FloatingSun.jpg$\r\n\r\nThis workshop is open to photographers of all skill levels and is limited to eight participants. There is no heavy hiking involved; we will be doing a lot of walking on paved roads as well as trails, but this is not a wilderness trek. To get the most out of this workshop you should be able to walk at least a few miles along easy terrain and expect to arise before dawn and stay out into the night each day.\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is _all-inclusive_, we are sorry that we cannot offer transportation. The park has very tight roads and at times we'll be driving on unpaved passages, which would be clumsy for a large van. We'll make our best efforts to organize carpools, but you should be prepared to \"play it by ear\" or to caravan in your own vehicle.\r\n\r\nAs with all of our workshops, each person will be given a National Geographic park map, a two-way radio, and a generous package of information on the history, geography, and climate of the national park as well as photography tips and guidelines to use during the workshop and in the future.\r\n\r\nh2. Itinerary\r\n\r\nOctober 25th\r\n\r\nWe'll meet late in the day in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. You may drive to Gatlinburg directly or fly into Knoxville, Tennessee. We'll have introductions at dinner that evening.\r\n\r\nh3. October 26th-29th\r\n\r\n$image:right/Places/SmokyMountains/GoldMorning.jpg$\r\n\r\nFrom our hotel we'll make two trips daily into the park: one before dawn to photograph from the first light of day until mid-morning, and a second trip a few hours before the sun goes down to capture sunset and then move to another location for astronomical and night photography.\r\n\r\nEach day we will have opportunities to photograph the abundant wildlife in the park including deer, black bears, birds, and more. We'll take you to the best locations to capture beautiful landscapes and make sure you're in the best places at the best times. For example, we will walk into Cades Cove—a lush valley surrounded by mountains and a popular destination—just before dawn to capture the best light of day while tourists in their cars wait for the gate to be unlocked and miss out on all the good stuff!\r\n\r\nSome of the locations we'll photograph are:\r\n\r\n* Cades Cove\r\n* Clingman's Dome\r\n* Laurel Falls\r\n* New Found Gap Road\r\n* Mingus Mill\r\n\r\nh3.

The park spans a wide range of elevations, from 875 to 6,643 feet above sea level. The variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of animal and plant life. About 10,000 species are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 90,000 undocumented species may also be present.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is scheduled to coincide with the peak of fall color in the park as well as the new moon. Though it's difficult to predict the peak of foliage change precisely, the range of elevations in the park gives the photographer a good deal of \"wiggle room.\" Even if colors haven't peaked at 800 feet, odds are good that at over 3,000 feet you'll see the full color of the Great Smokies. Thanks to the size of the park the night skies are very dark—especially during a new moon—which makes great astronomical images possible.\r\n\r\n$image:left/Places/SmokyMountains/FloatingSun.jpg$\r\n\r\nThis workshop is open to photographers of all skill levels and is limited to eight participants. There is no heavy hiking involved; we will be doing a lot of walking on paved roads as well as trails, but this is not a wilderness trek. To get the most out of this workshop you should be able to walk at least a few miles along easy terrain and expect to arise before dawn and stay out into the night each day.\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is _all-inclusive_, we are sorry that we cannot offer transportation. The park has very tight roads and at times we'll be driving on unpaved passages, which would be clumsy for a large van. We'll make our best efforts to organize carpools, but you should be prepared to \"play it by ear\" or to caravan in your own vehicle.\r\n\r\nAs with all of our workshops, each person will be given a National Geographic park map, a two-way radio, and a generous package of information on the history, geography, and climate of the national park as well as photography tips and guidelines to use during the workshop and in the future.\r\n\r\nh2. Itinerary\r\n\r\nOctober 25th\r\n\r\nWe'll meet late in the day in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. You may drive to Gatlinburg directly or fly into Knoxville, Tennessee. We'll have introductions at dinner that evening.\r\n\r\nh3. October 26th-29th\r\n\r\n$image:right/Places/SmokyMountains/GoldMorning.jpg$\r\n\r\nFrom our hotel we'll make two trips daily into the park: one before dawn to photograph from the first light of day until mid-morning, and a second trip a few hours before the sun goes down to capture sunset and then move to another location for astronomical and night photography.\r\n\r\nEach day we will have opportunities to photograph the abundant wildlife in the park including deer, black bears, birds, and more. We'll take you to the best locations to capture beautiful landscapes and make sure you're in the best places at the best times. For example, we will walk into Cades Cove—a lush valley surrounded by mountains and a popular destination—just before dawn to capture the best light of day while tourists in their cars wait for the gate to be unlocked and miss out on all the good stuff!\r\n\r\nSome of the locations we'll photograph are:\r\n\r\n* Cades Cove\r\n* Clingman's Dome\r\n* Laurel Falls\r\n* New Found Gap Road\r\n* Mingus Mill\r\n\r\nh3.

The park spans a wide range of elevations, from 875 to 6,643 feet above sea level. The variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of animal and plant life. About 10,000 species are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 90,000 undocumented species may also be present.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is scheduled to coincide with the peak of fall color in the park as well as the new moon. Though it's difficult to predict the peak of foliage change precisely, the range of elevations in the park gives the photographer a good deal of \"wiggle room.\" Even if colors haven't peaked at 800 feet, odds are good that at over 3,000 feet you'll see the full color of the Great Smokies. Thanks to the size of the park the night skies are very dark—especially during a new moon—which makes great astronomical images possible.\r\n\r\n$image:left/Places/SmokyMountains/FloatingSun.jpg$\r\n\r\nThis workshop is open to photographers of all skill levels and is limited to eight participants. There is no heavy hiking involved; we will be doing a lot of walking on paved roads as well as trails, but this is not a wilderness trek. To get the most out of this workshop you should be able to walk at least a few miles along easy terrain and expect to arise before dawn and stay out into the night each day.\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is _all-inclusive_, we are sorry that we cannot offer transportation. The park has very tight roads and at times we'll be driving on unpaved passages, which would be clumsy for a large van. We'll make our best efforts to organize carpools, but you should be prepared to \"play it by ear\" or to caravan in your own vehicle.\r\n\r\nAs with all of our workshops, each person will be given a National Geographic park map, a two-way radio, and a generous package of information on the history, geography, and climate of the national park as well as photography tips and guidelines to use during the workshop and in the future.\r\n\r\nh2. Itinerary\r\n\r\nOctober 25th\r\n\r\nWe'll meet late in the day in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. You may drive to Gatlinburg directly or fly into Knoxville, Tennessee. We'll have introductions at dinner that evening.\r\n\r\nh3. October 26th-29th\r\n\r\n$image:right/Places/SmokyMountains/GoldMorning.jpg$\r\n\r\nFrom our hotel we'll make two trips daily into the park: one before dawn to photograph from the first light of day until mid-morning, and a second trip a few hours before the sun goes down to capture sunset and then move to another location for astronomical and night photography.\r\n\r\nEach day we will have opportunities to photograph the abundant wildlife in the park including deer, black bears, birds, and more. We'll take you to the best locations to capture beautiful landscapes and make sure you're in the best places at the best times. For example, we will walk into Cades Cove—a lush valley surrounded by mountains and a popular destination—just before dawn to capture the best light of day while tourists in their cars wait for the gate to be unlocked and miss out on all the good stuff!\r\n\r\nSome of the locations we'll photograph are:\r\n\r\n* Cades Cove\r\n* Clingman's Dome\r\n* Laurel Falls\r\n* New Found Gap Road\r\n* Mingus Mill\r\n\r\nh3.

The park spans a wide range of elevations, from 875 to 6,643 feet above sea level. The variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of animal and plant life. About 10,000 species are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 90,000 undocumented species may also be present.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is scheduled to coincide with the peak of fall color in the park as well as the new moon. Though it's difficult to predict the peak of foliage change precisely, the range of elevations in the park gives the photographer a good deal of \"wiggle room.\" Even if colors haven't peaked at 800 feet, odds are good that at over 3,000 feet you'll see the full color of the Great Smokies. Thanks to the size of the park the night skies are very dark—especially during a new moon—which makes great astronomical images possible.\r\n\r\n$image:left/Places/SmokyMountains/FloatingSun.jpg$\r\n\r\nThis workshop is open to photographers of all skill levels and is limited to eight participants. There is no heavy hiking involved; we will be doing a lot of walking on paved roads as well as trails, but this is not a wilderness trek. To get the most out of this workshop you should be able to walk at least a few miles along easy terrain and expect to arise before dawn and stay out into the night each day.\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is _all-inclusive_, we are sorry that we cannot offer transportation. The park has very tight roads and at times we'll be driving on unpaved passages, which would be clumsy for a large van. We'll make our best efforts to organize carpools, but you should be prepared to \"play it by ear\" or to caravan in your own vehicle.\r\n\r\nAs with all of our workshops, each person will be given a National Geographic park map, a two-way radio, and a generous package of information on the history, geography, and climate of the national park as well as photography tips and guidelines to use during the workshop and in the future.\r\n\r\nh2. Itinerary\r\n\r\nOctober 25th\r\n\r\nWe'll meet late in the day in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. You may drive to Gatlinburg directly or fly into Knoxville, Tennessee. We'll have introductions at dinner that evening.\r\n\r\nh3. October 26th-29th\r\n\r\n$image:right/Places/SmokyMountains/GoldMorning.jpg$\r\n\r\nFrom our hotel we'll make two trips daily into the park: one before dawn to photograph from the first light of day until mid-morning, and a second trip a few hours before the sun goes down to capture sunset and then move to another location for astronomical and night photography.\r\n\r\nEach day we will have opportunities to photograph the abundant wildlife in the park including deer, black bears, birds, and more. We'll take you to the best locations to capture beautiful landscapes and make sure you're in the best places at the best times. For example, we will walk into Cades Cove—a lush valley surrounded by mountains and a popular destination—just before dawn to capture the best light of day while tourists in their cars wait for the gate to be unlocked and miss out on all the good stuff!\r\n\r\nSome of the locations we'll photograph are:\r\n\r\n* Cades Cove\r\n* Clingman's Dome\r\n* Laurel Falls\r\n* New Found Gap Road\r\n* Mingus Mill\r\n\r\nh3. October 30th\r\n\r\nWe may make a last trip into the park to pick up any sights we haven't yet seen, and then it's farewell.

The park spans a wide range of elevations, from 875 to 6,643 feet above sea level. The variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of animal and plant life. About 10,000 species are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 90,000 undocumented species may also be present.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is scheduled to coincide with the peak of fall color in the park as well as the new moon. Though it\'s difficult to predict the peak of foliage change precisely, the range of elevations in the park gives the photographer a good deal of \"wiggle room.\" Even if colors haven\'t peaked at 800 feet, odds are good that at over 3,000 feet you\'ll see the full color of the Great Smokies. Thanks to the size of the park the night skies are very dark—especially during a new moon—which makes great astronomical images possible.\r\n\r\n$image:left/Places/SmokyMountains/FloatingSun.jpg$\r\n\r\nThis workshop is open to photographers of all skill levels and is limited to eight participants. There is no heavy hiking involved; we will be doing a lot of walking on paved roads as well as trails, but this is not a wilderness trek. To get the most out of this workshop you should be able to walk at least a few miles along easy terrain and expect to arise before dawn and stay out into the night each day.\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is _all-inclusive_, we are sorry that we cannot offer transportation. The park has very tight roads and at times we\'ll be driving on unpaved passages, which would be clumsy for a large van. We\'ll make our best efforts to organize carpools, but you should be prepared to \"play it by ear\" or to caravan in your own vehicle.\r\n\r\nAs with all of our workshops, each person will be given a National Geographic park map, a two-way radio, and a generous package of information on the history, geography, and climate of the national park as well as photography tips and guidelines to use during the workshop and in the future.\r\n\r\nh2. Itinerary\r\n\r\nOctober 25th\r\n\r\nWe\'ll meet late in the day in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. You may drive to Gatlinburg directly or fly into Knoxville, Tennessee. We\'ll have introductions at dinner that evening.\r\n\r\nh3. October 26th-29th\r\n\r\n$image:right/Places/SmokyMountains/GoldMorning.jpg$\r\n\r\nFrom our hotel we\'ll make two trips daily into the park: one before dawn to photograph from the first light of day until mid-morning, and a second trip a few hours before the sun goes down to capture sunset and then move to another location for astronomical and night photography.\r\n\r\nEach day we will have opportunities to photograph the abundant wildlife in the park including deer, black bears, birds, and more. We\'ll take you to the best locations to capture beautiful landscapes and make sure you\'re in the best places at the best times. For example, we will walk into Cades Cove—a lush valley surrounded by mountains and a popular destination—just before dawn to capture the best light of day while tourists in their cars wait for the gate to be unlocked and miss out on all the good stuff!\r\n\r\nSome of the locations we\'ll photograph are:\r\n\r\n* Cades Cove\r\n* Clingman\'s Dome\r\n* Laurel Falls\r\n* New Found Gap Road\r\n* Mingus Mill\r\n\r\nh3. October 30th\r\n\r\nWe may make a last trip into the park to pick up any sights we haven\'t yet seen, and then it\'s farewell. Check-out from the hotel is before noon.', `name` = 'Great Smoky Mountains National Park' WHERE `id` = 7[0m

This workshop is designed to coincide with the new moon, giving us nights filled with stars. If you have never done photography at night before, or if you want to get better at it, this is the right workshop for you. Between the two of us we have 12 years of experience making wonderful images at night. \r\n\r\n$image:right/Places/DeathValley/Tendrils.jpg$\r\n\r\nThis workshop gives you the opportunity to photograph a famous and unique location with two professional photographers who will help you get the *most* out of every hour and out of every exposure.\r\n\r\nh2. Who should attend this workshop?\r\n\r\nAnyone who wants to advance their photography skills and get the absolute most out of a trip to Death Valley. In a limited amount of time we\'ll bring you to the best locations at the best times and work with you both in the field and in front of the computer to help you get great results.\r\n\r\nh2. Itinerary\r\n\r\nHere\'s the plan.\r\n\r\nh3. Friday April 4th\r\n\r\nWe will meet in the afternoon (you\'ll be emailed the exact time and place to meet at least two weeks prior to the workshop). Each participant will receive a workshop package including information and equipment (listed below). We will then have introductions, get to know one another, and get a feel for what each of you hope to accomplish during the workshop. We will set out in the early evening to photograph sunset and then do an introduction to night photography.\r\n\r\nh3. Saturday April 5th - Monday April 7th\r\n\r\nEach day of the workshop will be broken up into three sessions, described here:\r\n\r\n*Session 1 - Dawn*\r\n\r\nWe\'ll meet in an agreed upon location and set out to photograph dawn, then return to the inn for breakfast.\r\n\r\n*Session 2 - Late morning*\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we\'ll get together to review the work we\'ve done so far, go over any questions, and plan shooting locations for the remainder of the day. Participants who shoot digital and have a laptop with them are welcome to share their work with the group. Chris and Aaron will be available to do one-on-one critiques and offer guidance.\r\n\r\nThere are a few locations that can be effective during morning and afternoon sun, such as Golden Canyon, so we may opt to explore one of those locations together during the day. If you wish to explore on your own, you are welcome to.\r\n\r\n*Session 3 - Sunset*\r\n\r\nWe will travel to our chosen location to photograph sunset. After night falls, we will commence night photography sessions. It is not unusual for the ambitious in the group to photograph well into the night.\r\n\r\nNote: Some of you may not want to join us for the next sunrise session. You can meet us at breakfast, normally around 9-9:30 AM.\r\n\r\nSince the conditions in Death Valley change from day to day, it\'s impossible to predict the perfect location for each session. Both Chris and Aaron have a good deal of experience with Death Valley and will plan our locations to best fit the changing conditions. Our first priority is making great photographs, no matter what the circumstances.\r\n\r\nThough we will be photographing locations as a group, each will offer the opportunity to spread out across a large area. Two-way radios can come in handy, so we\'re going to give you one. It\'s an effective method for the group to communicate across distances of a mile or more, and we\'ll also use the radios to communicate between vehicles while traveling to each location.\r\n\r\nh2. Registration\r\n\r\nThe cost of this once-in-a-lifetime experience is only $1,199 and is open to photographers of all skill levels. To register, please \"send us an email\":mailto:dvworkshop@fisheyegallery.com. We accept all major credit cards as well as personal checks. After you contact us, we\'ll mail you our registration package. Workshops are filled on a first-come first-served basis, so don\'t miss out!\r\n\r\nWorkshop fees are refundable up to 60 days before the workshop, less 10% for processing fees. Within 60 days of the workshop a refund is not possible.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to e-mail us with any questions.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will have a maximum of ten participants. Sorry, but no guests are permitted to tag along. We find that the group is most focused and productive when we are all actively photographing, and we don\'t want to dilute the experience for any of our attendees.\r\n\r\nh3. Important Notes\r\n\r\n* This is not an all-inclusive trip and as such does not include transportation, food, or lodging. Your registration package will contain a thorough list of available hotels and campgrounds as well as our advice on staying in Death Valley.\r\n* Though meal cost is not included, we\'ll eat at the same time each day and you may wish to join us, or feel free to go out on your own during this time.\r\n* Your registration package will also include detailed information on the trip as well as a very basic questionnaire that we use to tailor the workshop for you.\r\n* We will not be taking any long hikes, but some hiking will be required. This is not a stressful amount of exercise by any means, but you should be in decent physical shape and able to navigate the irregular desert terrain.\r\n\r\nh2. Gear\r\n\r\nYou\'ll need some things on this trip...\r\n\r\nh3. What you should bring\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is open to all skill levels, you should have at least a 35mm SLR (digital or film) camera and a tripod. You should also have a basic understanding of how your camera works. We would be glad to help you get the most out of your equipment while on the workshop, but it won\'t be a fundamental course, so be sure you are familiar with the basics.\r\n\r\nIf you want to brush up or review, you may want to read these articles (posted here):\r\n\r\n* \"Histograms, Huh?\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/06/03/histograms-huh/\r\n* \"Be a Control Freak--Shooting Modes Explained\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/05/29/be-a-control-freak-shooting-modes-explained/\r\n* \"Focal Length Reciprocal Rule\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/05/22/focal-length-reciprocal-rule/\r\n\r\nAnd also these assorted articles from Earthbound Light Photography:\r\n\r\n* \"I Bought a Digital Camera But My Photos Are Still Blurry\":http://www.earthboundlight.com/phototips/digital-photography-still-photography.html\r\n* \"Program vs. Aperture Priority vs. Shutter Priority vs. Manual\":http://www.earthboundlight.com/phototips/program-aperture-shutter-priority-manual-exposure.html\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in advice on what to bring (or what to buy), you can \"email Chris\":mailto:cblake@curiouslens.com. He has a lot of equipment experience and would be happy to share it with you.\r\n\r\nThe weather in Death Valley can go from very warm to very cold. You should pack accordingly, keeping in mind that in windy conditions before dawn and after the sun goes down it can feel very cold.\r\n\r\nh3. What we will give you\r\n\r\nAs part of the workshop experience, we will provide you with a few essential items that we have found to be indispensable on these trips. The Death Valley Workshop package includes a GMRS(General Mobile Radio Service) (family band) two-way radio with several-mile range; a bright xenon flashlight for light painting and general navigation; a rugged, waterproof National Geographic map of the park that we will refer to often; and lots of information about the art and science of photographing on location and specifically in Death Valley. All of these items are, of course, yours to keep.\r\n\r\nh2. Who are you?\r\n\r\nHere\'s a little about us and why you\'re going to love to learn and explore with us in Death Valley.\r\n\r\nh3. Christopher Blake\r\n\r\nI am a fine art travel photographer living in the Boston area. I have worked exclusively with digital cameras for the past six years, focusing on traditional fine art landscapes, HDR (high dynamic range), and night photography. I have an extensive background in information technology and I leverage that knowledge to get the most out of my photographs. I am excited to share my experience in travel photography with you in Death Valley!\r\n\r\nView Chris\'s gallery, \"The Curious Lens\":http://www.curiouslens.com.\r\n\r\nh3. Aaron Bieber\r\n\r\nI am an illustrator, photographer, web and graphic designer living and working on the scenic Connecticut coast (I am also the author of this blog). Though I have been very serious about photography for many years, I come from a traditional art background and I have written at length on the topics of photography as an art form and the techniques and practices unique to photography as a medium for artistic expression. My main interests in photography are geometric abstractions and exploring the invisible world as can only be seen through the lens of a camera.\r\n\r\nWith over ten years of Photoshop experience and as an outspoken fan of Photoshop Lightroom, I do my best work in post-production. I look forward to helping you make the most of a very unique experience during this workshop!\r\n\r\nView Aaron\'s gallery, \"Fisheye Multimedia Galleries\":http://www.fisheyegallery.com', `name` = 'Death Valley National Park' WHERE `id` = 1[0m

In a limited amount of time we\'ll bring you to the best locations at the best times and work with you both in the field and in front of the computer to help you get great results.\r\n\r\nh2. Itinerary\r\n\r\nHere\'s the plan.\r\n\r\nh3. Friday April 4th\r\n\r\nWe will meet in the afternoon (you\'ll be emailed the exact time and place to meet at least two weeks prior to the workshop). Each participant will receive a workshop package including information and equipment (listed below). We will then have introductions, get to know one another, and get a feel for what each of you hope to accomplish during the workshop. We will set out in the early evening to photograph sunset and then do an introduction to night photography.\r\n\r\nh3. Saturday April 5th - Monday April 7th\r\n\r\nEach day of the workshop will be broken up into three sessions, described here:\r\n\r\n*Session 1 - Dawn*\r\n\r\nWe\'ll meet in an agreed upon location and set out to photograph dawn, then return to the inn for breakfast.\r\n\r\n*Session 2 - Late morning*\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we\'ll get together to review the work we\'ve done so far, go over any questions, and plan shooting locations for the remainder of the day. Participants who shoot digital and have a laptop with them are welcome to share their work with the group. Chris and Aaron will be available to do one-on-one critiques and offer guidance.\r\n\r\nThere are a few locations that can be effective during morning and afternoon sun, such as Golden Canyon, so we may opt to explore one of those locations together during the day. If you wish to explore on your own, you are welcome to.\r\n\r\n*Session 3 - Sunset*\r\n\r\nWe will travel to our chosen location to photograph sunset. After night falls, we will commence night photography sessions. It is not unusual for the ambitious in the group to photograph well into the night.\r\n\r\nNote: Some of you may not want to join us for the next sunrise session. You can meet us at breakfast, normally around 9-9:30 AM.\r\n\r\nSince the conditions in Death Valley change from day to day, it\'s impossible to predict the perfect location for each session. Both Chris and Aaron have a good deal of experience with Death Valley and will plan our locations to best fit the changing conditions. Our first priority is making great photographs, no matter what the circumstances.\r\n\r\nThough we will be photographing locations as a group, each will offer the opportunity to spread out across a large area. Two-way radios can come in handy, so we\'re going to give you one. It\'s an effective method for the group to communicate across distances of a mile or more, and we\'ll also use the radios to communicate between vehicles while traveling to each location.\r\n\r\nh2. Registration\r\n\r\nThe cost of this once-in-a-lifetime experience is only $1,199 and is open to photographers of all skill levels. To register, please \"send us an email\":mailto:dvworkshop@fisheyegallery.com. We accept all major credit cards as well as personal checks. After you contact us, we\'ll mail you our registration package. Workshops are filled on a first-come first-served basis, so don\'t miss out!\r\n\r\nWorkshop fees are refundable up to 60 days before the workshop, less 10% for processing fees. Within 60 days of the workshop a refund is not possible.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to e-mail us with any questions.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will have a maximum of ten participants. Sorry, but no guests are permitted to tag along. We find that the group is most focused and productive when we are all actively photographing, and we don\'t want to dilute the experience for any of our attendees.\r\n\r\nh3. Important Notes\r\n\r\n* This is not an all-inclusive trip and as such does not include transportation, food, or lodging. Your registration package will contain a thorough list of available hotels and campgrounds as well as our advice on staying in Death Valley.\r\n* Though meal cost is not included, we\'ll eat at the same time each day and you may wish to join us, or feel free to go out on your own during this time.\r\n* Your registration package will also include detailed information on the trip as well as a very basic questionnaire that we use to tailor the workshop for you.\r\n* We will not be taking any long hikes, but some hiking will be required. This is not a stressful amount of exercise by any means, but you should be in decent physical shape and able to navigate the irregular desert terrain.\r\n\r\nh2. Gear\r\n\r\nYou\'ll need some things on this trip...\r\n\r\nh3. What you should bring\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is open to all skill levels, you should have at least a 35mm SLR (digital or film) camera and a tripod. You should also have a basic understanding of how your camera works. We would be glad to help you get the most out of your equipment while on the workshop, but it won\'t be a fundamental course, so be sure you are familiar with the basics.\r\n\r\nIf you want to brush up or review, you may want to read these articles (posted here):\r\n\r\n* \"Histograms, Huh?\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/06/03/histograms-huh/\r\n* \"Be a Control Freak--Shooting Modes Explained\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/05/29/be-a-control-freak-shooting-modes-explained/\r\n* \"Focal Length Reciprocal Rule\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/05/22/focal-length-reciprocal-rule/\r\n\r\nAnd also these assorted articles from Earthbound Light Photography:\r\n\r\n* \"I Bought a Digital Camera But My Photos Are Still Blurry\":http://www.earthboundlight.com/phototips/digital-photography-still-photography.html\r\n* \"Program vs. Aperture Priority vs. Shutter Priority vs. Manual\":http://www.earthboundlight.com/phototips/program-aperture-shutter-priority-manual-exposure.html\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in advice on what to bring (or what to buy), you can \"email Chris\":mailto:cblake@curiouslens.com. He has a lot of equipment experience and would be happy to share it with you.\r\n\r\nThe weather in Death Valley can go from very warm to very cold. You should pack accordingly, keeping in mind that in windy conditions before dawn and after the sun goes down it can feel very cold.\r\n\r\nh3. What we will give you\r\n\r\nAs part of the workshop experience, we will provide you with a few essential items that we have found to be indispensable on these trips. The Death Valley Workshop package includes a GMRS(General Mobile Radio Service) (family band) two-way radio with several-mile range; a bright xenon flashlight for light painting and general navigation; a rugged, waterproof National Geographic map of the park that we will refer to often; and lots of information about the art and science of photographing on location and specifically in Death Valley. All of these items are, of course, yours to keep.\r\n\r\nh2. Who are you?\r\n\r\nHere\'s a little about us and why you\'re going to love to learn and explore with us in Death Valley.\r\n\r\nh3. Christopher Blake\r\n\r\nI am a fine art travel photographer living in the Boston area. I have worked exclusively with digital cameras for the past six years, focusing on traditional fine art landscapes, HDR (high dynamic range), and night photography. I have an extensive background in information technology and I leverage that knowledge to get the most out of my photographs. I am excited to share my experience in travel photography with you in Death Valley!\r\n\r\nView Chris\'s gallery, \"The Curious Lens\":http://www.curiouslens.com.\r\n\r\nh3. Aaron Bieber\r\n\r\nI am an illustrator, photographer, web and graphic designer living and working on the scenic Connecticut coast (I am also the author of this blog). Though I have been very serious about photography for many years, I come from a traditional art background and I have written at length on the topics of photography as an art form and the techniques and practices unique to photography as a medium for artistic expression. My main interests in photography are geometric abstractions and exploring the invisible world as can only be seen through the lens of a camera.\r\n\r\nWith over ten years of Photoshop experience and as an outspoken fan of Photoshop Lightroom, I do my best work in post-production. I look forward to helping you make the most of a very unique experience during this workshop!\r\n\r\nView Aaron\'s gallery, \"Fisheye Multimedia Galleries\":http://www.fisheyegallery.com', `name` = 'Death Valley National Park' WHERE `id` = 1[0m

The park spans a wide range of elevations, from 875 to 6,643 feet above sea level. The variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of animal and plant life. About 10,000 species are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 90,000 undocumented species may also be present.\r\n\r\nThis workshop is scheduled to coincide with the peak of fall color in the park as well as the new moon. Though it\'s difficult to predict the peak of foliage change precisely, the range of elevations in the park gives the photographer a good deal of \"wiggle room.\" Even if colors haven\'t peaked at 800 feet, odds are good that at over 3,000 feet you\'ll see the full color of the Great Smokies. Thanks to the size of the park the night skies are very dark—especially during a new moon—which makes great astronomical images possible.\r\n\r\n$image:left/Places/SmokyMountains/FloatingSun.jpg$\r\n\r\nThis workshop is open to photographers of all skill levels and is limited to eight participants. There is no heavy hiking involved; we will be doing a lot of walking on paved roads as well as trails, but this is not a wilderness trek. To get the most out of this workshop you should be able to walk at least a few miles along easy terrain and expect to arise before dawn and stay out into the night each day.\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is _all-inclusive_, we are sorry that we cannot offer transportation. The park has very tight roads and at times we\'ll be driving on unpaved passages, which would be clumsy for a large van. We\'ll make our best efforts to organize carpools, but you should be prepared to \"play it by ear\" or to caravan in your own vehicle.\r\n\r\nAs with all of our workshops, each person will be given a National Geographic park map, a two-way radio, and a generous package of information on the history, geography, and climate of the national park as well as photography tips and guidelines to use during the workshop and in the future.\r\n\r\nh2. Itinerary\r\n\r\nOctober 25th\r\n\r\nWe\'ll meet late in the day in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. You may drive to Gatlinburg directly or fly into Knoxville, Tennessee. We\'ll have introductions at dinner that evening.\r\n\r\nh3. October 26th-29th\r\n\r\n$image:right/Places/SmokyMountains/GoldMorning.jpg$\r\n\r\nFrom our hotel we\'ll make two trips daily into the park: one before dawn to photograph from the first light of day until mid-morning, and a second trip a few hours before the sun goes down to capture sunset and then move to another location for astronomical and night photography.\r\n\r\nEach day we will have opportunities to photograph the abundant wildlife in the park including deer, black bears, birds, and more. We\'ll take you to the best locations to capture beautiful landscapes and make sure you\'re in the best places at the best times. For example, we will walk into Cades Cove—a lush valley surrounded by mountains and a popular destination—just before dawn to capture the best light of day while tourists in their cars wait for the gate to be unlocked and miss out on all the good stuff!\r\n\r\nSome of the locations we\'ll photograph are:\r\n\r\n* Cades Cove\r\n* Clingman\'s Dome\r\n* Laurel Falls\r\n* New Found Gap Road\r\n* Mingus Mill\r\n\r\nh3. October 30th\r\n\r\nWe may make a last trip into the park to pick up any sights we haven\'t yet seen, and then it\'s farewell.

This workshop is designed to coincide with the new moon, giving us nights filled with stars. If you have never done photography at night before, or if you want to get better at it, this is the right workshop for you. Between the two of us we have 12 years of experience making wonderful images at night. \r\n\r\n$image:right/Places/DeathValley/Tendrils.jpg$\r\n\r\nThis workshop gives you the opportunity to photograph a famous and unique location with two professional photographers who will help you get the *most* out of every hour and out of every exposure.\r\n\r\nh2. Who should attend this workshop?\r\n\r\nAnyone who wants to advance their photography skills and get the absolute most out of a trip to Death Valley. In a limited amount of time we\'ll bring you to the best locations at the best times and work with you both in the field and in front of the computer to help you get great results.\r\n\r\nh2. Itinerary\r\n\r\nHere\'s the plan.\r\n\r\nh3. Friday April 4th\r\n\r\nWe will meet in the afternoon (you\'ll be emailed the exact time and place to meet at least two weeks prior to the workshop). Each participant will receive a workshop package including information and equipment (listed below). We will then have introductions, get to know one another, and get a feel for what each of you hope to accomplish during the workshop. We will set out in the early evening to photograph sunset and then do an introduction to night photography.\r\n\r\nh3. Saturday April 5th - Monday April 7th\r\n\r\nEach day of the workshop will be broken up into three sessions, described here:\r\n\r\n*Session 1 - Dawn*\r\n\r\nWe\'ll meet in an agreed upon location and set out to photograph dawn, then return to the inn for breakfast.\r\n\r\n*Session 2 - Late morning*\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we\'ll get together to review the work we\'ve done so far, go over any questions, and plan shooting locations for the remainder of the day. Participants who shoot digital and have a laptop with them are welcome to share their work with the group. Chris and Aaron will be available to do one-on-one critiques and offer guidance.\r\n\r\nThere are a few locations that can be effective during morning and afternoon sun, such as Golden Canyon, so we may opt to explore one of those locations together during the day. If you wish to explore on your own, you are welcome to.\r\n\r\n*Session 3 - Sunset*\r\n\r\nWe will travel to our chosen location to photograph sunset. After night falls, we will commence night photography sessions. It is not unusual for the ambitious in the group to photograph well into the night.\r\n\r\nNote: Some of you may not want to join us for the next sunrise session. You can meet us at breakfast, normally around 9-9:30 AM.\r\n\r\nSince the conditions in Death Valley change from day to day, it\'s impossible to predict the perfect location for each session. Both Chris and Aaron have a good deal of experience with Death Valley and will plan our locations to best fit the changing conditions. Our first priority is making great photographs, no matter what the circumstances.\r\n\r\nThough we will be photographing locations as a group, each will offer the opportunity to spread out across a large area. Two-way radios can come in handy, so we\'re going to give you one. It\'s an effective method for the group to communicate across distances of a mile or more, and we\'ll also use the radios to communicate between vehicles while traveling to each location.\r\n\r\nh2. Registration\r\n\r\nThe cost of this once-in-a-lifetime experience is only $1,199 and is open to photographers of all skill levels. To register, please \"send us an email\":mailto:dvworkshop@fisheyegallery.com. We accept all major credit cards as well as personal checks. After you contact us, we\'ll mail you our registration package. Workshops are filled on a first-come first-served basis, so don\'t miss out!\r\n\r\nWorkshop fees are refundable up to 60 days before the workshop, less 10% for processing fees. Within 60 days of the workshop a refund is not possible.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to e-mail us with any questions.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will have a maximum of ten participants. Sorry, but no guests are permitted to tag along. We find that the group is most focused and productive when we are all actively photographing, and we don\'t want to dilute the experience for any of our attendees.\r\n\r\nh3. Important Notes\r\n\r\n* This is not an all-inclusive trip and as such does not include transportation, food, or lodging. Your registration package will contain a thorough list of available hotels and campgrounds as well as our advice on staying in Death Valley.\r\n* Though meal cost is not included, we\'ll eat at the same time each day and you may wish to join us, or feel free to go out on your own during this time.\r\n* Your registration package will also include detailed information on the trip as well as a very basic questionnaire that we use to tailor the workshop for you.\r\n* We will not be taking any long hikes, but some hiking will be required. This is not a stressful amount of exercise by any means, but you should be in decent physical shape and able to navigate the irregular desert terrain.\r\n\r\nh2. Gear\r\n\r\nYou\'ll need some things on this trip...\r\n\r\nh3. What you should bring\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is open to all skill levels, you should have at least a 35mm SLR (digital or film) camera and a tripod. You should also have a basic understanding of how your camera works. We would be glad to help you get the most out of your equipment while on the workshop, but it won\'t be a fundamental course, so be sure you are familiar with the basics.\r\n\r\nIf you want to brush up or review, you may want to read these articles (posted here):\r\n\r\n* \"Histograms, Huh?\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/06/03/histograms-huh/\r\n* \"Be a Control Freak--Shooting Modes Explained\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/05/29/be-a-control-freak-shooting-modes-explained/\r\n* \"Focal Length Reciprocal Rule\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/05/22/focal-length-reciprocal-rule/\r\n\r\nAnd also these assorted articles from Earthbound Light Photography:\r\n\r\n* \"I Bought a Digital Camera But My Photos Are Still Blurry\":http://www.earthboundlight.com/phototips/digital-photography-still-photography.html\r\n* \"Program vs. Aperture Priority vs. Shutter Priority vs. Manual\":http://www.earthboundlight.com/phototips/program-aperture-shutter-priority-manual-exposure.html\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in advice on what to bring (or what to buy), you can \"email Chris\":mailto:cblake@curiouslens.com. He has a lot of equipment experience and would be happy to share it with you.\r\n\r\nThe weather in Death Valley can go from very warm to very cold. You should pack accordingly, keeping in mind that in windy conditions before dawn and after the sun goes down it can feel very cold.\r\n\r\nh3. What we will give you\r\n\r\nAs part of the workshop experience, we will provide you with a few essential items that we have found to be indispensable on these trips. The Death Valley Workshop package includes a GMRS(General Mobile Radio Service) (family band) two-way radio with several-mile range; a bright xenon flashlight for light painting and general navigation; a rugged, waterproof National Geographic map of the park that we will refer to often; and lots of information about the art and science of photographing on location and specifically in Death Valley. All of these items are, of course, yours to keep.\r\n\r\nh2. Who are you?\r\n\r\nHere\'s a little about us and why you\'re going to love to learn and explore with us in Death Valley.\r\n\r\nh3. Christopher Blake\r\n\r\nI am a fine art travel photographer living in the Boston area. I have worked exclusively with digital cameras for the past six years, focusing on traditional fine art landscapes, HDR (high dynamic range), and night photography. I have an extensive background in information technology and I leverage that knowledge to get the most out of my photographs. I am excited to share my experience in travel photography with you in Death Valley!\r\n\r\nView Chris\'s gallery, \"The Curious Lens\":http://www.curiouslens.com.\r\n\r\nh3. Aaron Bieber\r\n\r\nI am an illustrator, photographer, web and graphic designer living and working on the scenic Connecticut coast (I am also the author of this blog). Though I have been very serious about photography for many years, I come from a traditional art background and I have written at length on the topics of photography as an art form and the techniques and practices unique to photography as a medium for artistic expression. My main interests in photography are geometric abstractions and exploring the invisible world as can only be seen through the lens of a camera.\r\n\r\nWith over ten years of Photoshop experience and as an outspoken fan of Photoshop Lightroom, I do my best work in post-production. I look forward to helping you make the most of a very unique experience during this workshop!\r\n\r\nView Aaron\'s gallery, \"Fisheye Multimedia Galleries\":http://www.fisheyegallery.com', `name` = 'Death Valley National Park' WHERE `id` = 1[0m

If you have never done photography at night before, or if you want to get better at it, this is the right workshop for you. Between the two of us we have 12 years of experience making wonderful images at night. \r\n\r\n$image:right/Places/DeathValley/Tendrils.jpg$\r\n\r\nThis workshop gives you the opportunity to photograph a famous and unique location with two professional photographers who will help you get the *most* out of every hour and out of every exposure.\r\n\r\nh2. Who should attend this workshop?\r\n\r\nAnyone who wants to advance their photography skills and get the absolute most out of a trip to Death Valley. In a limited amount of time we\'ll bring you to the best locations at the best times and work with you both in the field and in front of the computer to help you get great results.\r\n\r\nh2. Itinerary\r\n\r\nHere\'s the plan.\r\n\r\nh3. Friday April 4th\r\n\r\nWe will meet in the afternoon (you\'ll be emailed the exact time and place to meet at least two weeks prior to the workshop). Each participant will receive a workshop package including information and equipment (listed below). We will then have introductions, get to know one another, and get a feel for what each of you hope to accomplish during the workshop. We will set out in the early evening to photograph sunset and then do an introduction to night photography.\r\n\r\nh3. Saturday April 5th - Monday April 7th\r\n\r\nEach day of the workshop will be broken up into three sessions, described here:\r\n\r\n*Session 1 - Dawn*\r\n\r\nWe\'ll meet in an agreed upon location and set out to photograph dawn, then return to the inn for breakfast.\r\n\r\n*Session 2 - Late morning*\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we\'ll get together to review the work we\'ve done so far, go over any questions, and plan shooting locations for the remainder of the day. Participants who shoot digital and have a laptop with them are welcome to share their work with the group. Chris and Aaron will be available to do one-on-one critiques and offer guidance.\r\n\r\nThere are a few locations that can be effective during morning and afternoon sun, such as Golden Canyon, so we may opt to explore one of those locations together during the day. If you wish to explore on your own, you are welcome to.\r\n\r\n*Session 3 - Sunset*\r\n\r\nWe will travel to our chosen location to photograph sunset. After night falls, we will commence night photography sessions. It is not unusual for the ambitious in the group to photograph well into the night.\r\n\r\nNote: Some of you may not want to join us for the next sunrise session. You can meet us at breakfast, normally around 9-9:30 AM.\r\n\r\nSince the conditions in Death Valley change from day to day, it\'s impossible to predict the perfect location for each session. Both Chris and Aaron have a good deal of experience with Death Valley and will plan our locations to best fit the changing conditions. Our first priority is making great photographs, no matter what the circumstances.\r\n\r\nThough we will be photographing locations as a group, each will offer the opportunity to spread out across a large area. Two-way radios can come in handy, so we\'re going to give you one. It\'s an effective method for the group to communicate across distances of a mile or more, and we\'ll also use the radios to communicate between vehicles while traveling to each location.\r\n\r\nh2. Registration\r\n\r\nThe cost of this once-in-a-lifetime experience is only $1,199 and is open to photographers of all skill levels. To register, please \"send us an email\":mailto:dvworkshop@fisheyegallery.com. We accept all major credit cards as well as personal checks. After you contact us, we\'ll mail you our registration package. Workshops are filled on a first-come first-served basis, so don\'t miss out!\r\n\r\nWorkshop fees are refundable up to 60 days before the workshop, less 10% for processing fees. Within 60 days of the workshop a refund is not possible.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to e-mail us with any questions.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will have a maximum of ten participants. Sorry, but no guests are permitted to tag along. We find that the group is most focused and productive when we are all actively photographing, and we don\'t want to dilute the experience for any of our attendees.\r\n\r\nh3. Important Notes\r\n\r\n* This is not an all-inclusive trip and as such does not include transportation, food, or lodging. Your registration package will contain a thorough list of available hotels and campgrounds as well as our advice on staying in Death Valley.\r\n* Though meal cost is not included, we\'ll eat at the same time each day and you may wish to join us, or feel free to go out on your own during this time.\r\n* Your registration package will also include detailed information on the trip as well as a very basic questionnaire that we use to tailor the workshop for you.\r\n* We will not be taking any long hikes, but some hiking will be required. This is not a stressful amount of exercise by any means, but you should be in decent physical shape and able to navigate the irregular desert terrain.\r\n\r\nh2. Gear\r\n\r\nYou\'ll need some things on this trip...\r\n\r\nh3. What you should bring\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is open to all skill levels, you should have at least a 35mm SLR (digital or film) camera and a tripod. You should also have a basic understanding of how your camera works. We would be glad to help you get the most out of your equipment while on the workshop, but it won\'t be a fundamental course, so be sure you are familiar with the basics.\r\n\r\nIf you want to brush up or review, you may want to read these articles (posted here):\r\n\r\n* \"Histograms, Huh?\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/06/03/histograms-huh/\r\n* \"Be a Control Freak--Shooting Modes Explained\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/05/29/be-a-control-freak-shooting-modes-explained/\r\n* \"Focal Length Reciprocal Rule\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/05/22/focal-length-reciprocal-rule/\r\n\r\nAnd also these assorted articles from Earthbound Light Photography:\r\n\r\n* \"I Bought a Digital Camera But My Photos Are Still Blurry\":http://www.earthboundlight.com/phototips/digital-photography-still-photography.html\r\n* \"Program vs. Aperture Priority vs. Shutter Priority vs. Manual\":http://www.earthboundlight.com/phototips/program-aperture-shutter-priority-manual-exposure.html\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in advice on what to bring (or what to buy), you can \"email Chris\":mailto:cblake@curiouslens.com. He has a lot of equipment experience and would be happy to share it with you.\r\n\r\nThe weather in Death Valley can go from very warm to very cold. You should pack accordingly, keeping in mind that in windy conditions before dawn and after the sun goes down it can feel very cold.\r\n\r\nh3. What we will give you\r\n\r\nAs part of the workshop experience, we will provide you with a few essential items that we have found to be indispensable on these trips. The Death Valley Workshop package includes a GMRS(General Mobile Radio Service) (family band) two-way radio with several-mile range; a bright xenon flashlight for light painting and general navigation; a rugged, waterproof National Geographic map of the park that we will refer to often; and lots of information about the art and science of photographing on location and specifically in Death Valley. All of these items are, of course, yours to keep.\r\n\r\nh2. Who are you?\r\n\r\nHere\'s a little about us and why you\'re going to love to learn and explore with us in Death Valley.\r\n\r\nh3. Christopher Blake\r\n\r\nI am a fine art travel photographer living in the Boston area. I have worked exclusively with digital cameras for the past six years, focusing on traditional fine art landscapes, HDR (high dynamic range), and night photography. I have an extensive background in information technology and I leverage that knowledge to get the most out of my photographs. I am excited to share my experience in travel photography with you in Death Valley!\r\n\r\nView Chris\'s gallery, \"The Curious Lens\":http://www.curiouslens.com.\r\n\r\nh3. Aaron Bieber\r\n\r\nI am an illustrator, photographer, web and graphic designer living and working on the scenic Connecticut coast (I am also the author of this blog). Though I have been very serious about photography for many years, I come from a traditional art background and I have written at length on the topics of photography as an art form and the techniques and practices unique to photography as a medium for artistic expression. My main interests in photography are geometric abstractions and exploring the invisible world as can only be seen through the lens of a camera.\r\n\r\nWith over ten years of Photoshop experience and as an outspoken fan of Photoshop Lightroom, I do my best work in post-production. I look forward to helping you make the most of a very unique experience during this workshop!\r\n\r\nView Aaron\'s gallery, \"Fisheye Multimedia Galleries\":http://www.fisheyegallery.com', `name` = 'Death Valley National Park' WHERE `id` = 1[0m

It is not unusual for the ambitious in the group to photograph well into the night.\r\n\r\nNote: Some of you may not want to join us for the next sunrise session. You can meet us at breakfast, normally around 9-9:30 AM.\r\n\r\nSince the conditions in Death Valley change from day to day, it\'s impossible to predict the perfect location for each session. Both Chris and Aaron have a good deal of experience with Death Valley and will plan our locations to best fit the changing conditions. Our first priority is making great photographs, no matter what the circumstances.\r\n\r\nThough we will be photographing locations as a group, each will offer the opportunity to spread out across a large area. Two-way radios can come in handy, so we\'re going to give you one. It\'s an effective method for the group to communicate across distances of a mile or more, and we\'ll also use the radios to communicate between vehicles while traveling to each location.\r\n\r\nh2. Registration\r\n\r\nThe cost of this once-in-a-lifetime experience is only $1,199 and is open to photographers of all skill levels. To register, please \"send us an email\":mailto:dvworkshop@fisheyegallery.com. We accept all major credit cards as well as personal checks. After you contact us, we\'ll mail you our registration package. Workshops are filled on a first-come first-served basis, so don\'t miss out!\r\n\r\nWorkshop fees are refundable up to 60 days before the workshop, less 10% for processing fees. Within 60 days of the workshop a refund is not possible.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to e-mail us with any questions.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will have a maximum of ten participants. Sorry, but no guests are permitted to tag along. We find that the group is most focused and productive when we are all actively photographing, and we don\'t want to dilute the experience for any of our attendees.\r\n\r\nh3. Important Notes\r\n\r\n* This is not an all-inclusive trip and as such does not include transportation, food, or lodging. Your registration package will contain a thorough list of available hotels and campgrounds as well as our advice on staying in Death Valley.\r\n* Though meal cost is not included, we\'ll eat at the same time each day and you may wish to join us, or feel free to go out on your own during this time.\r\n* Your registration package will also include detailed information on the trip as well as a very basic questionnaire that we use to tailor the workshop for you.\r\n* We will not be taking any long hikes, but some hiking will be required. This is not a stressful amount of exercise by any means, but you should be in decent physical shape and able to navigate the irregular desert terrain.\r\n\r\nh2. Gear\r\n\r\nYou\'ll need some things on this trip...\r\n\r\nh3. What you should bring\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is open to all skill levels, you should have at least a 35mm SLR (digital or film) camera and a tripod. You should also have a basic understanding of how your camera works. We would be glad to help you get the most out of your equipment while on the workshop, but it won\'t be a fundamental course, so be sure you are familiar with the basics.\r\n\r\nIf you want to brush up or review, you may want to read these articles (posted here):\r\n\r\n* \"Histograms, Huh?\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/06/03/histograms-huh/\r\n* \"Be a Control Freak--Shooting Modes Explained\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/05/29/be-a-control-freak-shooting-modes-explained/\r\n* \"Focal Length Reciprocal Rule\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/05/22/focal-length-reciprocal-rule/\r\n\r\nAnd also these assorted articles from Earthbound Light Photography:\r\n\r\n* \"I Bought a Digital Camera But My Photos Are Still Blurry\":http://www.earthboundlight.com/phototips/digital-photography-still-photography.html\r\n* \"Program vs. Aperture Priority vs. Shutter Priority vs. Manual\":http://www.earthboundlight.com/phototips/program-aperture-shutter-priority-manual-exposure.html\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in advice on what to bring (or what to buy), you can \"email Chris\":mailto:cblake@curiouslens.com. He has a lot of equipment experience and would be happy to share it with you.\r\n\r\nThe weather in Death Valley can go from very warm to very cold. You should pack accordingly, keeping in mind that in windy conditions before dawn and after the sun goes down it can feel very cold.\r\n\r\nh3. What we will give you\r\n\r\nAs part of the workshop experience, we will provide you with a few essential items that we have found to be indispensable on these trips. The Death Valley Workshop package includes a GMRS(General Mobile Radio Service) (family band) two-way radio with several-mile range; a bright xenon flashlight for light painting and general navigation; a rugged, waterproof National Geographic map of the park that we will refer to often; and lots of information about the art and science of photographing on location and specifically in Death Valley. All of these items are, of course, yours to keep.\r\n\r\nh2. Who are you?\r\n\r\nHere\'s a little about us and why you\'re going to love to learn and explore with us in Death Valley.\r\n\r\nh3. Christopher Blake\r\n\r\nI am a fine art travel photographer living in the Boston area. I have worked exclusively with digital cameras for the past six years, focusing on traditional fine art landscapes, HDR (high dynamic range), and night photography. I have an extensive background in information technology and I leverage that knowledge to get the most out of my photographs. I am excited to share my experience in travel photography with you in Death Valley!\r\n\r\nView Chris\'s gallery, \"The Curious Lens\":http://www.curiouslens.com.\r\n\r\nh3. Aaron Bieber\r\n\r\nI am an illustrator, photographer, web and graphic designer living and working on the scenic Connecticut coast (I am also the author of this blog). Though I have been very serious about photography for many years, I come from a traditional art background and I have written at length on the topics of photography as an art form and the techniques and practices unique to photography as a medium for artistic expression. My main interests in photography are geometric abstractions and exploring the invisible world as can only be seen through the lens of a camera.\r\n\r\nWith over ten years of Photoshop experience and as an outspoken fan of Photoshop Lightroom, I do my best work in post-production. I look forward to helping you make the most of a very unique experience during this workshop!\r\n\r\nView Aaron\'s gallery, \"Fisheye Multimedia Galleries\":http://www.fisheyegallery.com', `name` = 'Death Valley National Park' WHERE `id` = 1[0m

In a limited amount of time we\'ll bring you to the best locations at the best times and work with you both in the field and in front of the computer to help you get great results.\r\n\r\nh2. Itinerary\r\n\r\nHere\'s the plan.\r\n\r\nh3. Friday April 4th\r\n\r\nWe will meet in the afternoon (you\'ll be emailed the exact time and place to meet at least two weeks prior to the workshop). Each participant will receive a workshop package including information and equipment (listed below). We will then have introductions, get to know one another, and get a feel for what each of you hope to accomplish during the workshop. We will set out in the early evening to photograph sunset and then do an introduction to night photography.\r\n\r\nh3. Saturday April 5th - Monday April 7th\r\n\r\nEach day of the workshop will be broken up into three sessions, described here:\r\n\r\n*Session 1 - Dawn*\r\n\r\nWe\'ll meet in an agreed upon location and set out to photograph dawn, then return to the inn for breakfast.\r\n\r\n*Session 2 - Late morning*\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we\'ll get together to review the work we\'ve done so far, go over any questions, and plan shooting locations for the remainder of the day. Participants who shoot digital and have a laptop with them are welcome to share their work with the group. Chris and Aaron will be available to do one-on-one critiques and offer guidance.\r\n\r\nThere are a few locations that can be effective during morning and afternoon sun, such as Golden Canyon, so we may opt to explore one of those locations together during the day. If you wish to explore on your own, you are welcome to.\r\n\r\n*Session 3 - Sunset*\r\n\r\nWe will travel to our chosen location to photograph sunset.

You should also have a basic understanding of how your camera works. We would be glad to help you get the most out of your equipment while on the workshop, but it won\'t be a fundamental course, so be sure you are familiar with the basics.\r\n\r\nIf you want to brush up or review, you may want to read these articles (posted here):\r\n\r\n* \"Histograms, Huh?\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/06/03/histograms-huh/\r\n* \"Be a Control Freak--Shooting Modes Explained\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/05/29/be-a-control-freak-shooting-modes-explained/\r\n* \"Focal Length Reciprocal Rule\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/05/22/focal-length-reciprocal-rule/\r\n\r\nAnd also these assorted articles from Earthbound Light Photography:\r\n\r\n* \"I Bought a Digital Camera But My Photos Are Still Blurry\":http://www.earthboundlight.com/phototips/digital-photography-still-photography.html\r\n* \"Program vs. Aperture Priority vs. Shutter Priority vs. Manual\":http://www.earthboundlight.com/phototips/program-aperture-shutter-priority-manual-exposure.html\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in advice on what to bring (or what to buy), you can \"email Chris\":mailto:cblake@curiouslens.com. He has a lot of equipment experience and would be happy to share it with you.\r\n\r\nThe weather in Death Valley can go from very warm to very cold. You should pack accordingly, keeping in mind that in windy conditions before dawn and after the sun goes down it can feel very cold.\r\n\r\nh3. What we will give you\r\n\r\nAs part of the workshop experience, we will provide you with a few essential items that we have found to be indispensable on these trips. The Death Valley Workshop package includes a GMRS(General Mobile Radio Service) (family band) two-way radio with several-mile range; a bright xenon flashlight for light painting and general navigation; a rugged, waterproof National Geographic map of the park that we will refer to often; and lots of information about the art and science of photographing on location and specifically in Death Valley. All of these items are, of course, yours to keep.\r\n\r\nh2. Who are you?\r\n\r\nHere\'s a little about us and why you\'re going to love to learn and explore with us in Death Valley.\r\n\r\nh3. Christopher Blake\r\n\r\nI am a fine art travel photographer living in the Boston area. I have worked exclusively with digital cameras for the past six years, focusing on traditional fine art landscapes, HDR (high dynamic range), and night photography. I have an extensive background in information technology and I leverage that knowledge to get the most out of my photographs. I am excited to share my experience in travel photography with you in Death Valley!\r\n\r\nView Chris\'s gallery, \"The Curious Lens\":http://www.curiouslens.com.\r\n\r\nh3. Aaron Bieber\r\n\r\nI am an illustrator, photographer, web and graphic designer living and working on the scenic Connecticut coast (I am also the author of this blog). Though I have been very serious about photography for many years, I come from a traditional art background and I have written at length on the topics of photography as an art form and the techniques and practices unique to photography as a medium for artistic expression. My main interests in photography are geometric abstractions and exploring the invisible world as can only be seen through the lens of a camera.\r\n\r\nWith over ten years of Photoshop experience and as an outspoken fan of Photoshop Lightroom, I do my best work in post-production. I look forward to helping you make the most of a very unique experience during this workshop!\r\n\r\nView Aaron\'s gallery, \"Fisheye Multimedia Galleries\":http://www.fisheyegallery.com', `name` = 'Death Valley National Park' WHERE `id` = 1[0m

We'll spend four days and nights making photographs from before sunrise until well into the night. Aaron and Chris will serve as your guides to aesthetic approach and technical application as you explore some of these breathtaking Death Valley locations:\r\n\r\n* Badwater\r\n* Artist's Palette\r\n* Dante's View\r\n* Stovepipe Well Dunes\r\n* Eureka Dunes\r\n* Golden Canyon\r\n* Devil's Golf Course\r\n* The Alabama Hills\r\n* and more!\r\n\r\n$register$\r\n\r\nThere will be a strong focus on night photography including work with light painting and star trails. This workshop is designed to coincide with the new moon, giving us nights filled with stars. If you have never done photography at night before, or if you want to get better at it, this is the right workshop for you. Between the two of us we have 12 years of experience making wonderful images at night. \r\n\r\n$image:right/Places/DeathValley/Tendrils.jpg$\r\n\r\nThis workshop gives you the opportunity to photograph a famous and unique location with two professional photographers who will help you get the *most* out of every hour and out of every exposure.\r\n\r\nh2. Who should attend this workshop?\r\n\r\nAnyone who wants to advance their photography skills and get the absolute most out of a trip to Death Valley. In a limited amount of time we'll bring you to the best locations at the best times and work with you both in the field and in front of the computer to help you get great results.\r\n\r\nh2. Itinerary\r\n\r\nHere's the plan.\r\n\r\nh3. Friday April 4th\r\n\r\nWe will meet in the afternoon (you'll be emailed the exact time and place to meet at least two weeks prior to the workshop). Each participant will receive a workshop package including information and equipment (listed below). We will then have introductions, get to know one another, and get a feel for what each of you hope to accomplish during the workshop. We will set out in the early evening to photograph sunset and then do an introduction to night photography.\r\n\r\nh3. Saturday April 5th - Monday April 7th\r\n\r\nEach day of the workshop will be broken up into three sessions, described here:\r\n\r\n*Session 1 - Dawn*\r\n\r\nWe'll meet in an agreed upon location and set out to photograph dawn, then return to the inn for breakfast.\r\n\r\n*Session 2 - Late morning*\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we'll get together to review the work we've done so far, go over any  questions, and plan shooting locations for the remainder of the day. Participants who shoot digital and have a laptop with them are welcome to share their work with the group. Chris and Aaron will be available to do one-on-one critiques and offer guidance.\r\n\r\nThere are a few locations that can be effective during morning and afternoon sun, such as Golden Canyon, so we may opt to explore one of those locations together during the day. If you wish to explore on your own, you are welcome to.\r\n\r\n*Session 3 - Sunset*\r\n\r\nWe will travel to our chosen location to photograph sunset. After night falls, we will commence night photography sessions. It is not unusual for the ambitious in the group to photograph well into the night.\r\n\r\nNote: Some of you may not want to join us for the next sunrise session. You can meet us at breakfast, normally around 9-9:30 AM.\r\n\r\nSince the conditions in Death Valley change from day to day, it's impossible to predict the perfect location for each session. Both Chris and Aaron have a good deal of experience with Death Valley and will plan our locations to best fit the changing conditions. Our first priority is making great photographs, no matter what the circumstances.\r\n\r\nThough we will be photographing locations as a group, each will offer the opportunity to spread out across a large area. Two-way radios can come in handy, so we're going to give you one. It's an effective method for the group to communicate across distances of a mile or more, and we'll also use the radios to communicate between vehicles while traveling to each location.\r\n\r\nh2. Registration\r\n\r\nThe cost of this once-in-a-lifetime experience is only $1,199 and is open to photographers of all skill levels. To register, please \"send us an email\":mailto:dvworkshop@fisheyegallery.com. We accept all major credit cards as well as personal checks. After you contact us, we'll mail you our registration package. Workshops are filled on a first-come first-served basis, so don't miss out!\r\n\r\nWorkshop fees are refundable up to 60 days before the workshop, less 10% for processing fees. Within 60 days of the workshop a refund is not possible.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to e-mail us with any questions.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will have a maximum of ten participants. Sorry, but no guests are permitted to tag along. We find that the group is most focused and productive when we are all actively photographing, and we don't want to dilute the experience for any of our attendees.\r\n\r\nh3. Important Notes\r\n\r\n* This is not an all-inclusive trip and as such does not include transportation, food, or lodging. Your registration package will contain a thorough list of available hotels and campgrounds as well as our advice on staying in Death Valley.\r\n* Though meal cost is not included, we'll eat at the same time each day and you may wish to join us, or feel free to go out on your own during this time.\r\n* Your registration package will also include detailed information on the trip as well as a very basic questionnaire that we use to tailor the workshop for you.\r\n* We will not be taking any long hikes, but some hiking will be required. This is not a stressful amount of exercise by any means, but you should be in decent physical shape and able to navigate the irregular desert terrain.\r\n\r\nh2. Gear\r\n\r\nYou'll need some things on this trip...\r\n\r\nh3. What you should bring\r\n\r\nAlthough this workshop is open to all skill levels, you should have at least a 35mm SLR (digital or film) camera and a tripod. You should also have a basic understanding of how your camera works. We would be glad to help you get the most out of your equipment while on the workshop, but it won't be a fundamental course, so be sure you are familiar with the basics.\r\n\r\nIf you want to brush up or review, you may want to read these articles (posted here):\r\n\r\n* \"Histograms, Huh?\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/06/03/histograms-huh/\r\n* \"Be a Control Freak--Shooting Modes Explained\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/05/29/be-a-control-freak-shooting-modes-explained/\r\n* \"Focal Length Reciprocal Rule\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com/2007/05/22/focal-length-reciprocal-rule/\r\n\r\nAnd also these assorted articles from Earthbound Light Photography:\r\n\r\n* \"I Bought a Digital Camera But My Photos Are Still Blurry\":http://www.earthboundlight.com/phototips/digital-photography-still-photography.html\r\n* \"Program vs. Aperture Priority vs. Shutter Priority vs. Manual\":http://www.earthboundlight.com/phototips/program-aperture-shutter-priority-manual-exposure.html\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in advice on what to bring (or what to buy), you can \"email Chris\":mailto:cblake@curiouslens.com. He has a lot of equipment experience and would be happy to share it with you.\r\n\r\nThe weather in Death Valley can go from very warm to very cold. You should pack accordingly, keeping in mind that in windy conditions before dawn and after the sun goes down it can feel very cold.\r\n\r\nh3. What we will give you\r\n\r\nAs part of the workshop experience, we will provide you with a few essential items that we have found to be indispensable on these trips.  The Death Valley Workshop package includes a GMRS(General Mobile Radio Service) (family band) two-way radio with several-mile range; a bright xenon flashlight for light painting and general navigation; a rugged, waterproof National Geographic map of the park that we will refer to often; and lots of information about the art and science of photographing on location and specifically in Death Valley. All of these items are, of course, yours to keep.\r\n\r\nh2. Who are you?\r\n\r\nHere's a little about us and why you're going to love to learn and explore with us in Death Valley.\r\n\r\nh3. Christopher Blake\r\n\r\nI am a fine art travel photographer living in the Boston area. I have worked exclusively with digital cameras for the past six years, focusing on traditional fine art landscapes, HDR (high dynamic range), and night photography. I have an extensive background in information technology and I leverage that knowledge to get the most out of my photographs. I am excited to share my experience in travel photography with you in Death Valley!\r\n\r\nView Chris's gallery, \"The Curious Lens\":http://www.curiouslens.com.\r\n\r\nh3. Aaron Bieber\r\n\r\nI am an illustrator, photographer, web and graphic designer living and working on the scenic Connecticut coast (I am also the author of this blog). Though I have been very serious about photography for many years, I come from a traditional art background and I have written at length on the topics of photography as an art form and the techniques and practices unique to photography as a medium for artistic expression. My main interests in photography are geometric abstractions and exploring the invisible world as can only be seen through the lens of a camera.\r\n\r\nWith over ten years of Photoshop experience and as an outspoken fan of Photoshop Lightroom, I do my best work in post-production.

Christopher Blake\r\n\r\nI am a fine art travel photographer living in the Boston area. I have worked exclusively with digital cameras for the past six years, focusing on traditional fine art landscapes, HDR (high dynamic range), and night photography. With ten years of experience in information technology, I have developed techniques and processes to streamline the digital workflow and continually leverage my knowledge to get the most out of my photographs.\r\n\r\nIn addition to my extensive IT background I spent two years working in a small photo studio, focusing on studio and wedding photography. I have experience in studio lighting, posing and wedding photography. I have moved away from studio and wedding photography, though on occasion I will photograph a wedding.\r\n\r\nI'm currently the publisher and owner of the website \"curiouslens.com\":http://www.curiouslens.com, where I sell and license my fine art photographs. I've spent the last years working on creating the collection of images you see today. I continue to travel and run photography workshops around the US.\r\n\r\nView Chris' gallery, \"The Curious Lens\":http://www.curiouslens.com.\r\n\r\n%{display:block;border-top:1px solid silver;font-size:1px;margin:30px 0 30px 0}&nbsp;%\r\n\r\n%{float:right;margin:0 0 5px 5px;}!/images/aaron.jpg!%\r\n\r\nh3. Aaron Bieber\r\n\r\nI am an illustrator, photographer, web and graphic designer, and the president and founder of Fisheye Multimedia, a business specializing in digital photographic restoration since 1999. I earned my degree in graphic design and have done freelance print and web design work for individuals and businesses in the US and abroad.\r\n\r\nThough I come from a \"traditional\" art background, I have been very serious about digital photography for many years. I have written at length on the topics of photography as an art form and the techniques and practices unique to photography as a medium for artistic expression. My interest in photography is the exploration of the invisible world as can only be seen through the lens of a camera.\r\n\r\nWith over ten years of Photoshop experience and as an outspoken fan of Photoshop Lightroom, I am very comfortable in the \"digital darkroom\" and always seek new ways to bring technology to bear on the challenges of fine art photography.\r\n\r\nView Aaron's gallery, \"Fisheye Multimedia Galleries\":http://www.fisheyegallery.com.\r\n\r\nRead Aaron's blog, \"Single-Serving Photo\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com.", "title"=>"Biographies"}, "preview"=>"Preview"}

Christopher Blake\r\n\r\nI am a fine art travel photographer living in the Boston area. I have worked exclusively with digital cameras for the past six years, focusing on traditional fine art landscapes, HDR (high dynamic range), and night photography. With ten years of experience in information technology, I have developed techniques and processes to streamline the digital workflow and continually leverage my knowledge to get the most out of my photographs.\r\n\r\nIn addition to my extensive IT background I spent two years working in a small photo studio, focusing on studio and wedding photography. I have experience in studio lighting, posing and wedding photography. I have moved away from studio and wedding photography, though on occasion I will photograph a wedding.\r\n\r\nI'm currently the publisher and owner of the website \"curiouslens.com\":http://www.curiouslens.com, where I sell and license my fine art photographs. I've spent the last years working on creating the collection of images you see today. I continue to travel and run photography workshops around the US.\r\n\r\nView Chris' gallery, \"The Curious Lens\":http://www.curiouslens.com.\r\n\r\n%{display:block;border-top:1px solid silver;font-size:1px;margin:30px 0 30px 0}&nbsp;%\r\n\r\n%{float:right;margin:0 0 5px 5px;}!/images/aaron.jpg!%\r\n\r\nh3. Aaron Bieber\r\n\r\nI am an illustrator, photographer, web and graphic designer, and the president and founder of Fisheye Multimedia, a business specializing in digital photographic restoration since 1999. I earned my degree in graphic design and have done freelance print and web design work for individuals and businesses in the US and abroad.\r\n\r\nThough I come from a \"traditional\" art background, I have been very serious about digital photography for many years. I have written at length on the topics of photography as an art form and the techniques and practices unique to photography as a medium for artistic expression. My interest in photography is the exploration of the invisible world as can only be seen through the lens of a camera.\r\n\r\nWith over ten years of Photoshop experience and as an outspoken fan of Photoshop Lightroom, I am very comfortable in the \"digital darkroom\" and always seek new ways to bring technology to bear on the challenges of fine art photography.\r\n\r\nView Aaron's gallery, \"Fisheye Multimedia Galleries\":http://www.fisheyegallery.com.\r\n\r\nRead Aaron's blog, \"Single-Serving Photo\":http://www.singleservingphoto.com.", "title"=>"Biographies"}, "preview"=>"Preview"}
